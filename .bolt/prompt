For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos. 

Responsive Design Check
Area	Responsive Design Rule
Layout/Grid	Use Tailwind grid/flex utilities with breakpoints (md, lg, xl)
Sidebar/Menu	Must collapse on small screens (hidden md:block, etc.)
Tables & Forms	Should stack on small screens using Tailwind classes
Cards/Widgets	Avoid fixed widths; use w-full, max-w-* as needed
