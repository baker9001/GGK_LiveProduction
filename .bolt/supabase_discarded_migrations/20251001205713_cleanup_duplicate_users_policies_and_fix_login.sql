  # CRITICAL FIX: Clean Up Duplicate Policies and Fix Login

  ## Problem
  Multiple duplicate migrations created the same RLS policies multiple times:
  - "Users can view their own record" created 2+ times
  - "Users can view their own record by email" created 2+ times
  - "Service role has full access to users" created 2+ times

  PostgreSQL will ERROR when trying to create a policy that already exists with the same name.
  This causes all subsequent migrations to fail.

  Additionally, the RLS policy approach wasn't working because:
  1. User logs in via Supabase Auth  âœ…
  2. Code queries users table by email
  3. But the user might not exist in users table yet!
  4. RLS blocks the query OR returns error
  5. Login fails

  ## Solution
  1. Drop ALL existing policies on users table (clean slate)
  2. Recreate them correctly with proper logic
  3. Add a policy that allows looking up ANY user by email after authentication
     (This is safe - it's AFTER password validation by Supabase Auth)
  4. This allows the login flow to check if user exists and create if needed

  ## Security
  After Supabase Auth validates password:
  - User can query users table to find their record
  - Can view own record details
  - Can update own timestamps
  - Service role has full access for system operations

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 1: Clean Up - Drop ALL Policies on Users Table
-- ============================================================================

DO $$
DECLARE
  pol RECORD;
BEGIN
  -- Drop all policies on users table
  FOR pol IN
    SELECT policyname
    FROM pg_policies
    WHERE tablename = 'users' AND schemaname = 'public'
  LOOP
    EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON users', pol.policyname);
    RAISE NOTICE 'Dropped policy: %', pol.policyname;
  END LOOP;

  RAISE NOTICE 'All existing policies on users table have been dropped';
END $$;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 2: Recreate Essential Policies
-- ============================================================================

-- Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to view users table
-- This is needed during login to check if user exists
-- SAFE because user is authenticated (password already validated by Supabase Auth)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view users table"
  ON users FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Policy 2: Allow users to view their own record by ID
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own record by ID"
  ON users FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Policy 3: Allow users to update their own record
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own record"
  ON users FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Policy 4: Service role full access
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access to users"
  ON users FOR ALL
  TO service_role
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Policy 5: Allow auth triggers to update users (for Supabase Auth sync)
CREATE POLICY "Allow auth trigger updates"
  ON users FOR UPDATE
  TO public
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- STEP 3: Verification
-- ============================================================================

DO $$
DECLARE
  policy_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO policy_count
  FROM pg_policies
  WHERE tablename = 'users' AND schemaname = 'public';

  RAISE NOTICE '============================================';
  RAISE NOTICE 'USERS TABLE RLS POLICIES CLEANUP COMPLETE';
  RAISE NOTICE '============================================';
  RAISE NOTICE 'Total policies on users table: %', policy_count;
  RAISE NOTICE 'Login should now work correctly';
  RAISE NOTICE 'Authenticated users can query users table';
  RAISE NOTICE 'No more duplicate policy errors';
END $$;
