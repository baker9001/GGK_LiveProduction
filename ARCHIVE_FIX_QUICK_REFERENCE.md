# Archive Error - Quick Fix Reference

## Problem
Archive button fails with error: `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "system"`

## Root Cause
Database trigger `track_paper_status_change()` was trying to insert the string `'system'` into a UUID column when no user was authenticated.

## Solution Applied
✅ Database migration created and applied successfully

### Changes Made:
1. Made `paper_status_history.changed_by` column nullable
2. Updated trigger to use NULL instead of 'system' string

## Test the Fix

### Quick Test Steps:
1. Go to Questions Setup & QA page
2. Find any paper (Draft, QA Review, or Published)
3. Click "Archive" button
4. Click "Archive" again to confirm
5. **Expected Result:** Paper archives successfully without errors

### Verify in Database:
```sql
-- Check recent status changes
SELECT paper_id, previous_status, new_status, changed_by, changed_at
FROM paper_status_history
ORDER BY changed_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## What Now Works
- ✅ Archive papers
- ✅ Restore papers from archive
- ✅ All status transitions (Draft → QA → Published → Archived)
- ✅ Status changes without user authentication
- ✅ System-initiated status changes

## Files Modified
- `supabase/migrations/fix_paper_status_history_changed_by_column.sql`

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Ready to use immediately

## No Code Changes Needed
The fix was entirely in the database layer. No frontend or backend code changes required.

## For Developers

### The Technical Issue:
```sql
-- BEFORE (Broken):
COALESCE(NEW.last_status_change_by, 'system')  -- ❌ Can't insert string into UUID column

-- AFTER (Fixed):
NEW.last_status_change_by  -- ✅ NULL is valid for UUID columns
```

### Migration Applied:
```sql
ALTER TABLE paper_status_history ALTER COLUMN changed_by DROP NOT NULL;
-- Now NULL represents "no user" or "system change"
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this affect existing data?**
A: No, existing records are unchanged. Only future status changes are affected.

**Q: What about security?**
A: No change to security. RLS policies and foreign keys remain intact.

**Q: Can I rollback this change?**
A: Yes, but you'd need to provide a default UUID first for NULL values.

**Q: Why NULL instead of a "system" user?**
A: NULL is semantically correct and doesn't require creating fake user accounts.

## Troubleshooting

If the archive still doesn't work:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify you have the latest migration applied
3. Check user permissions for the papers_setup table
4. Verify paper status is in a valid state for archiving
