# Attachment Card Display and MCQ Duplicate Answer Fix

## Summary
Fixed three critical UX issues in the question review and preview modes:
1. **Duplicate Correct Answer Display for MCQ Questions (QuestionCard)**: MCQ questions were showing the correct answer twice - once highlighted in the options list and again in a separate card below
2. **Teacher Review Box Removed (DynamicAnswerField)**: Removed the redundant "Teacher Review - MCQ Question" amber box that was duplicating the correct answer information
3. **Attachment Display Enhancement**: Attachments are now displayed as professional card components with proper styling, metadata, and actions

## Changes Made

### 1. QuestionCard.tsx - Fixed Duplicate MCQ Correct Answer Display
**File**: `/src/app/system-admin/learning/practice-management/papers-setup/tabs/components/QuestionCard.tsx`

**Issue**:
- MCQ questions displayed the correct answer in two places:
  1. Highlighted in green within the options list (correct)
  2. In a separate yellow "Correct Answer(s)" card below the options (duplicate)

**Fix**:
- Modified the answer display condition from `!hasParts` to `!hasParts && question.question_type !== 'mcq'`
- The correct answer card now only displays for non-MCQ question types (descriptive, true/false, calculation, etc.)
- MCQ questions continue to show the correct answer highlighted in green within the options list

**Code Change**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Showed for all question types
{!hasParts && (
  <div>
    <label>Correct Answer(s)</label>
    <DynamicAnswerField ... />
  </div>
)}

// AFTER: Only shows for non-MCQ questions
{!hasParts && question.question_type !== 'mcq' && (
  <div>
    <label>Correct Answer(s)</label>
    <DynamicAnswerField ... />
  </div>
)}
```

### 2. DynamicAnswerField.tsx - Removed Teacher Review Box
**File**: `/src/components/shared/DynamicAnswerField.tsx`

**Issue**:
- MCQ questions displayed a large amber "Teacher Review - MCQ Question" box (lines 1332-1462)
- This box duplicated the correct answer information already shown in the highlighted options above
- Added unnecessary visual clutter and confusion

**Fix**:
- Completely removed the "QA Preview Teacher Insights" section (130+ lines of code)
- MCQ questions now only show correct answers highlighted in green within the options
- Cleaner, more streamlined presentation

**Code Change**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Showed teacher insights box with duplicate answer info
{shouldShowTeacherInsights && (
  <div className="mt-4 p-4 bg-amber-50 ...">
    <h4>Teacher Review - MCQ Question</h4>
    {/* 130+ lines of duplicate answer display */}
  </div>
)}

// AFTER: Removed entirely - answer already shown in options above
```

### 3. TeacherReviewMode.tsx - Enhanced Attachment Display
**File**: `/src/app/system-admin/learning/practice-management/papers-setup/tabs/components/TeacherReviewMode.tsx`

**Enhancement**: Upgraded the `AttachmentGallery` component to display attachments as professional card components:

#### For Image Attachments:
- Card with rounded borders and shadow
- Image displayed in a padded container
- Footer section showing:
  - Image icon
  - File name
  - Expand button (zoom icon)
  - Open in new tab button

#### For Non-Image Attachments:
- Card with gradient background
- Icon container with background
- File name and type displayed prominently
- Download/open button with hover effects

**Visual Features**:
- 2px border with hover effect (changes to blue)
- Shadow that increases on hover
- Smooth transitions for all interactive elements
- Dark mode support throughout
- Consistent spacing and padding

### 4. EnhancedQuestionPreview.tsx - Enhanced Attachment Display
**File**: `/src/components/shared/EnhancedQuestionPreview.tsx`

**Enhancement**: Applied the same card-based attachment display to the question preview modal:

#### Updates Made:
- Consistent card styling with TeacherReviewMode
- Image attachments show in cards with footer metadata
- Non-image attachments display in gradient cards
- All action buttons (zoom, download, open) use consistent styling
- Proper dark mode support

#### Features:
