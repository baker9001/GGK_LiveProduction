# Authentication Fix - Quick Reference Guide

## What Was Fixed?

Users couldn't login because RLS policies on the `users` table blocked access during authentication. We added self-access policies to fix this.

---

## The Solution (In Simple Terms)

**Before:** Only system admins could read the users table → Nobody could login ❌

**After:** Users can read their own record → Everyone can login ✅

## Testing Checklist

### Test These User Types:

- [ ] System Super Admin (SSA)
- [ ] Support Admin
- [ ] Entity Admin
- [ ] Teacher
- [ ] Student

### What to Test:

1. Login with valid credentials → Should succeed
2. Check user is redirected to correct dashboard
3. Verify user can access their features
4. Try invalid credentials → Should fail appropriately
5. Try inactive user → Should fail with message

---

## Quick Verification

Run this SQL to check policies are in place:

```sql
-- Check users table policies
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'users'
AND policyname LIKE '%can view their own%';

-- Should return: "Users can view their own record" with cmd "SELECT"
```

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Check These Things:

1. **User exists in database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, user_type, is_active
   FROM users
   WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
   ```

2. **User is active:**
   - Check `is_active = true` in the query above

3. **Email is verified:**
   - Check `email_verified = true` in the query above

4. **RLS is enabled:**
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
   FROM pg_tables
   WHERE tablename = 'users';
   ```

### Emergency Contacts

If authentication completely breaks:
1. Check Supabase dashboard for errors
2. Review migration logs
3. Contact database administrator

## Security Notes

- ✅ Users can ONLY read their own record
- ✅ Users CANNOT read other users' records
- ✅ System admins still have full access
- ✅ All other operations remain restricted

---

## No Code Changes Required

The fix is database-only. No changes needed to:
- Application code
- Authentication flow
- User interfaces
- API endpoints

**Just test and verify login works!**
