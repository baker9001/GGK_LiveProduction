# Auto-Map Questions Functionality Fix

## Problem Summary

The auto-map questions feature was not properly updating question data in the UI. When users clicked the "Auto-Map Questions" button, the mapping logic executed successfully in the background, but the changes were not reflected in the displayed questions.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue stemmed from a **state synchronization problem** between two separate state variables:

1. **`questionMappings`** - Stored the mapping results (chapter_id, topic_ids, subtopic_ids as UUIDs)
2. **`questions`** - Stored the actual question data displayed in the UI

When auto-mapping ran:
- The `autoMapQuestions` function correctly computed mappings and returned them
- The `questionMappings` state was updated with the new mappings (line 1183)
- **BUT** the `questions` state was not updated with the mapped values
- The UI components rendering question data only read from the `questions` array
- Since the `questions` array wasn't updated with the mapping results, the UI showed no changes

## The Fix

The solution involved merging the mapping results back into the questions state after auto-mapping completes. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. Removed Premature State Update

**Before:**
```typescript
setQuestions(enhancedQuestions);  // Updated too early, before mapping

const mappingResult = await autoMapQuestions(...);
setQuestionMappings(mappingResult.mappings);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const mappingResult = await autoMapQuestions(...);

// Merge mapping results into questions BEFORE updating state
const questionsWithMappings = enhancedQuestions.map(question => {
  // ... mapping logic ...
});

setQuestions(questionsWithMappings);
setQuestionMappings(mappingResult.mappings);
```

### 2. ID to Name Resolution

Added logic to convert mapping IDs to human-readable names:

```typescript
const questionsWithMappings = enhancedQuestions.map(question => {
  const mapping = mappingResult.mappings[question.id];

  if (mapping) {
    // Convert unit ID to name
    const unit = units.find(u => u.id === mapping.chapter_id);
    if (unit && !question.topic) {
      question.original_unit = unit.name;
    }

    // Convert topic IDs to names
    if (mapping.topic_ids && mapping.topic_ids.length > 0) {
      const topicNames = mapping.topic_ids
        .map(topicId => topics.find(t => t.id === topicId)?.name)
        .filter(Boolean);

      if (topicNames.length > 0) {
        question.topic = topicNames.join(', ');
        question.original_topics = topicNames;
      }
    }

    // Convert subtopic IDs to names
    if (mapping.subtopic_ids && mapping.subtopic_ids.length > 0) {
      const subtopicNames = mapping.subtopic_ids
        .map(subtopicId => subtopics.find(s => s.id === subtopicId)?.name)
        .filter(Boolean);

      if (subtopicNames.length > 0) {
        question.subtopic = subtopicNames.join(', ');
        question.original_subtopics = subtopicNames;
      }
    }
  }

  return question;
});
```

### 3. Automatic Validation Update

Added validation re-run after mapping to update validation errors:

```typescript
if (typeof validateQuestionsForImport === 'function') {
  try {
    const errors = validateQuestionsForImport(
      questionsWithMappings,
      mappingResult.mappings,
      existingQuestionNumbers,
      attachments
    );
    setValidationErrors(errors);
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn('Validation failed after auto-mapping:', err);
  }
}
```

### 4. Enhanced User Feedback

Improved the success notification to show more detailed information:

```typescript
const successCount = mappingResult.mappedCount + mappingResult.enhancedCount;
toast.success(
  `Auto-mapped ${successCount} question${successCount !== 1 ? 's' : ''}: ` +
  `${mappingResult.mappedCount} newly mapped, ${mappingResult.enhancedCount} enhanced`
);
```

## What Now Works

1. ✅ **Visible Mapping Updates** - When auto-map runs, questions immediately show their mapped units, topics, and subtopics
2. ✅ **Human-Readable Names** - Instead of UUIDs, users see actual topic and subtopic names
3. ✅ **Validation Sync** - Validation errors automatically clear for successfully mapped questions
4. ✅ **Multiple Topics/Subtopics** - Questions mapped to multiple topics display all of them (comma-separated)
5. ✅ **Better Feedback** - Users get detailed information about how many questions were mapped vs enhanced
6. ✅ **State Consistency** - Both `questions` and `questionMappings` states stay synchronized

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. **Navigate to Papers Setup > Questions Tab**
2. **Upload or import questions** from a paper
3. **Click "Auto-Map Questions" button**
4. **Verify:**
   - Questions display mapped unit/chapter names
   - Questions display mapped topic names (comma-separated if multiple)
   - Questions display mapped subtopic names (comma-separated if multiple)
   - Validation errors decrease for successfully mapped questions
   - Success toast shows correct count of mapped questions
5. **Edit a question** and verify the mapped values persist
6. **Expand question cards** to see the mapping details
7. **Try importing to database** to ensure mappings are correctly saved

## Files Modified

- `/src/app/system-admin/learning/practice-management/papers-setup/tabs/QuestionsTab.tsx`
  - Modified `handleAutoMapQuestions` function (lines 1096-1259)
  - Added mapping result merge logic
  - Added ID to name resolution
  - Added automatic validation update
  - Enhanced user feedback

## Technical Details

### Data Flow Before Fix

```
User clicks Auto-Map
  → enhancedQuestions created
  → setQuestions(enhancedQuestions) [no mapping info]
  → autoMapQuestions() called
  → mappingResult returned
  → setQuestionMappings(mappingResult.mappings) [separate from questions]
  → UI shows questions WITHOUT mapping info
```

### Data Flow After Fix

```
User clicks Auto-Map
  → enhancedQuestions created
  → autoMapQuestions() called
  → mappingResult returned
  → questionsWithMappings = merge(enhancedQuestions, mappingResult)
  → setQuestions(questionsWithMappings) [includes mapping info]
  → setQuestionMappings(mappingResult.mappings) [for form controls]
  → validateQuestionsForImport() runs
  → setValidationErrors(errors)
  → UI shows questions WITH mapping info
```

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful** - No compilation errors or warnings related to this change.

## Conclusion

The auto-map questions functionality now correctly updates the question data in the UI. Users can see immediate visual feedback when questions are auto-mapped, including the assigned units, topics, and subtopics. The fix ensures state consistency between the mappings and the displayed questions, resolving the synchronization issue that prevented changes from being visible.
