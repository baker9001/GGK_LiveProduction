## 3. RLS POLICY ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Helper Functions (All Secure ✅)

All 5 helper functions properly use `SECURITY DEFINER` to bypass RLS during checks:

| Function | Purpose | Security | Status |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| `is_admin_user(uuid)` | Check if user is system admin | SECURITY DEFINER | ✅ Correct |
| `is_entity_user(uuid)` | Check if user is entity admin | SECURITY DEFINER | ✅ Correct |
| `is_teacher(uuid)` | Check if user is teacher | SECURITY DEFINER | ✅ Correct |
| `is_student(uuid)` | Check if user is student | SECURITY DEFINER | ✅ Correct |
| `get_user_type(uuid)` | Get user type from users table | SECURITY DEFINER | ✅ Correct |

### 3.2 Core User Tables Policy Review

#### Users Table (5 policies)
```sql
✅ "Users can view their own record by ID" - SELECT auth.uid() = id
✅ "Authenticated users can view users table" - SELECT true (for lookups)
✅ "Users can update their own record" - UPDATE auth.uid() = id
✅ "Allow auth trigger updates" - UPDATE true (for system updates)
✅ "Service role full access to users" - ALL true
```
**Assessment:** ✅ Correct - Allows authentication flow and self-management

#### Admin Users Table (4 policies)
```sql
✅ "Admin users can view their own record" - SELECT auth.uid() = id
✅ "System admins can view all admin_users" - SELECT is_admin_user(auth.uid())
✅ "System admins can manage admin_users" - ALL is_admin_user(auth.uid())
✅ "Service role full access to admin_users" - ALL true
```
**Assessment:** ✅ Correct - Self-access + admin management

#### Entity Users Table (4 policies)
```sql
✅ "Entity users can view their own record" - SELECT user_id = auth.uid()
✅ "System admins can view all entity_users" - SELECT is_admin_user(auth.uid())
✅ "System admins can manage entity_users" - ALL is_admin_user(auth.uid())
✅ "Service role full access to entity_users" - ALL true
```
**Assessment:** ✅ Correct - Self-access + system admin management
**Gap:** ⚠️ Entity admins should be able to manage sub-admins (missing policy)

#### Teachers Table (4 policies)
```sql
✅ "Teachers can view their own record" - SELECT user_id = auth.uid()
✅ "System admins can view all teachers" - SELECT is_admin_user(auth.uid())
✅ "System admins can manage teachers" - ALL is_admin_user(auth.uid())
✅ "Service role full access to teachers" - ALL true
```
**Assessment:** ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
**Missing:** Entity admins should be able to manage teachers in their scope

#### Students Table (4 policies)
```sql
✅ "Students can view their own record" - SELECT user_id = auth.uid()
✅ "System admins can view all students" - SELECT is_admin_user(auth.uid())
✅ "System admins can manage students" - ALL is_admin_user(auth.uid())
✅ "Service role full access to students" - ALL true
```
**Assessment:** ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
**Missing:**
- Entity admins should be able to manage students in their scope
- Teachers should be able to view students they teach

### 3.3 Entity Hierarchy Tables

#### Companies Table (2 policies)
```sql
✅ "Authenticated users can view companies" - SELECT true
✅ "System admins can manage companies" - ALL is_admin_user(auth.uid())
```
**Assessment:** ✅ Correct - Reference data readable, only admins modify

#### Schools Table (7 policies)
```sql
✅ "System admins can view all schools" - SELECT (inline admin_users check)
✅ "System admins can create schools" - INSERT
✅ "System admins can update all schools" - UPDATE (inline check)
✅ "System admins can delete schools" - DELETE (inline check)
✅ "Entity admins manage schools in company" - ALL (company_id scope)
✅ "School admins manage assigned schools" - ALL (via entity_user_schools)
✅ "Company members access" - ALL (broad entity_users check)
```
**Assessment:** ⚠️ MIXED APPROACH
**Issues:**
- Inconsistent: Some use inline checks, should use `is_admin_user()`
- "Company members access" policy may be too broad
- Multiple overlapping policies

#### Branches Table (6 policies)
```sql
✅ "System admins can view all branches" - SELECT (inline check)
✅ "System admins can create branches" - INSERT
✅ "System admins can update all branches" - UPDATE (inline check)
✅ "System admins can delete branches" - DELETE (inline check)
✅ "Entity/school admins manage branches in scope" - ALL (school_id scope)
✅ "Branch admins manage assigned branches" - ALL (via entity_user_branches)
```
**Assessment:** ⚠️ INCONSISTENT
**Issues:** Should use helper functions like other tables

### 3.4 License Tables

#### Licenses Table (2 policies)
```sql
✅ "Authenticated users can view licenses" - SELECT true
✅ "System admins can manage licenses" - ALL is_admin_user(auth.uid())
```
**Assessment:** ⚠️ TOO PERMISSIVE
**Issue:** All authenticated users can view all licenses (should be scoped)

#### Student Licenses Table (9 policies)
```sql
✅ Multiple policies for student self-access
✅ System admin management
✅ Entity admin scoped access
```
**Assessment:** ✅ Well-structured with proper scoping

### 3.5 Mock Exam System (11 tables, 50+ policies)

All mock exam tables have comprehensive policies covering:
- Entity admin management (scoped by company)
- School admin access (scoped by assigned schools)
- Student participation (own records only)
- Teacher assignments (own assignments only)

**Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Properly scoped and comprehensive

### 3.6 Educational Content Tables

**Inconsistent RLS Status:**
- `edu_subjects` - RLS enabled, 2 policies ✅
- `edu_units` - RLS disabled ⚠️
- `edu_topics` - RLS disabled ⚠️
- `edu_subtopics` - RLS disabled ⚠️
- `edu_learning_objectives` - RLS disabled ⚠️
- `edu_specific_concepts` - RLS disabled ⚠️

**Assessment:** ⚠️ INCONSISTENT
**Issue:** Some content tables have RLS, others don't (should be consistent)

## 4. SECURITY ISSUES & PRIORITIES

### 4.1 CRITICAL (Fix Immediately)

**None identified** - Previous circular dependency issues have been resolved.

### 4.2 HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Within 1 Week)

#### Issue H1: Student Gamification Data Unprotected
**Tables Affected:**
- `student_achievements` - Student achievement records
- `student_daily_challenges` - Student challenge attempts
- `student_game_stats` - Student game statistics

**Risk:** Students can potentially view or modify other students' gamification data

**Recommendation:**
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE student_achievements ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE student_daily_challenges ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE student_game_stats ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add policies
CREATE POLICY "Students view own achievements"
  ON student_achievements FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (student_id IN (SELECT id FROM students WHERE user_id = auth.uid()));

-- Similar for other tables...
```

#### Issue H2: Entity Admins Cannot Manage Teachers/Students
**Tables Affected:** teachers, students

**Risk:** Entity admins need Edge Functions workarounds instead of direct database access

**Recommendation:**
Add scoped policies for entity admins:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Entity admins manage teachers in scope"
  ON teachers FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (
    company_id IN (
      SELECT company_id FROM entity_users
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND admin_level IN ('entity_admin', 'sub_entity_admin')
        AND is_active = true
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (/* same */);
```

#### Issue H3: Educational Content RLS Inconsistency
**Tables Affected:** edu_units, edu_topics, edu_subtopics, edu_learning_objectives

**Risk:** Inconsistent security model, unclear intent

**Recommendation:**
Either:
1. Enable RLS on all edu_ tables (if content is premium/restricted)
2. Disable RLS on edu_subjects to match others (if content is public)

Document decision and implement consistently.

### 4.3 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Fix Within 2 Weeks)

#### Issue M1: Licenses Table Too Permissive
**Current:** `"Authenticated users can view licenses" - SELECT true`

**Risk:** Users can see licenses not assigned to their entity

**Recommendation:**
Scope by company:
```sql
DROP POLICY "Authenticated users can view licenses" ON licenses;

CREATE POLICY "Entity users view company licenses"
  ON licenses FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (
    company_id IN (
      SELECT company_id FROM entity_users WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      UNION
      SELECT company_id FROM teachers WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      UNION
      SELECT company_id FROM students WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
    OR is_admin_user(auth.uid())
  );
```

#### Issue M2: Inline Admin Checks Inconsistent
**Tables:** schools, branches (use inline `auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM admin_users)`)

**Issue:** Inconsistent with helper function approach used elsewhere

**Recommendation:**
Update to use helper functions for consistency:
```sql
-- Replace inline checks with:
is_admin_user(auth.uid())
```

#### Issue M3: Teacher Access to Student Data Unclear
**Risk:** Teachers may need to view student performance but policies unclear

**Recommendation:**
Review application code to identify teacher → student data access patterns, then add explicit policies:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Teachers view students they teach"
  ON students FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (
    is_teacher(auth.uid())
    AND id IN (
      -- Logic to determine which students this teacher teaches
      -- Via class_sections, teacher_sections, etc.
    )
  );
```

### 4.4 LOW PRIORITY (Review & Document)

#### Issue L1: Service Role Policies
All tables have `"Service role full access" - ALL true`

**Current State:** ✅ Correct for system operations

**Recommendation:** Document which edge functions use service role and why

#### Issue L2: Users Table "Authenticated users can view"
**Current:** `SELECT true` allows all authenticated users to query users table

**Risk:** Low (but allows user enumeration)

**Recommendation:** Review if this is needed for application functionality

#### Issue L3: Answer Analytics Tables
Several answer/question analytics tables lack RLS

**Recommendation:** Review if these contain student-specific data that needs protection

---

## 5. CROSS-REFERENCE WITH APPLICATION CODE

### 5.1 Authentication Flow (✅ Correct)

**File:** `/src/app/signin/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Line 154-210: After Supabase Auth succeeds
const { data: userDataFetch } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('id, email, user_type, is_active, raw_user_meta_data')
  .eq('email', normalizedEmail)
  .maybeSingle();
```

**RLS Policy Match:** ✅
- Policy: `"Users can view their own record by ID"` allows `auth.uid() = id`
- Policy: `"Authenticated users can view users table"` allows email lookup
- **Status:** Working correctly after previous fixes

### 5.2 Permission Context (⚠️ Partial Match)

**File:** `/src/contexts/PermissionContext.tsx`

```typescript
// Lines 121-126: Fetches entity_users with admin_level
const { data: entityUser } = await supabase
  .from('entity_users')
  .select('admin_level, permissions, is_active, company_id')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .maybeSingle();
```

**RLS Policy Match:** ✅
- Policy: `"Entity users can view their own record"` allows `user_id = auth.uid()`
- **Status:** Working

### 5.3 Access Control Hook (⚠️ Needs Verification)

**File:** `/src/hooks/useAccessControl.ts`

Defines permissions like:
- `'create_teacher'`, `'modify_teacher'`, `'delete_teacher'`
- `'create_student'`, `'modify_student'`, `'delete_student'`

**Issue:** These application-level permissions assume entity admins can manage teachers/students, but **database RLS policies are missing** for this.

**Recommendation:** Add database policies to match application permissions (see Issue H2)

### 5.4 Module Security (✅ Correct)

**File:** `/src/hooks/useModuleSecurity.ts`

Route guards match user types correctly:
- System admins → `/system-admin`
- Entity admins → `/entity-module`
- Teachers → `/teachers-module`
- Students → `/student-module`

**Status:** ✅ Working

---

## 6. DATA OWNERSHIP PATTERNS

### 6.1 Multi-Tenant Hierarchy

```
companies (tenant root)
  ↓
schools (company_id)
  ↓
branches (school_id)
  ↓
students/teachers (company_id, school_id, branch_id)
```

### 6.2 User Scoping Patterns

| User Type | Scope Column | Hierarchy Level |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| System Admin | None | Global |
| Entity Admin (entity_admin) | company_id | Company |
| Entity Admin (school_admin) | via entity_user_schools | Schools |
| Entity Admin (branch_admin) | via entity_user_branches | Branches |
| Teacher | company_id, school_id, branch_id | Branch |
| Student | company_id, school_id, branch_id | Branch |

### 6.3 Junction Tables for Admin Scoping

- `entity_user_schools` - Maps school admins to schools
- `entity_user_branches` - Maps branch admins to branches
- `entity_admin_scope` - Additional scope definitions
- `entity_admin_hierarchy` - Admin hierarchy relationships

**Status:** ✅ Well-designed for flexible scoping

---

## 7. RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY

### 7.1 Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Enable RLS on student gamification tables** (student_achievements, student_daily_challenges, student_game_stats)
2. **Add entity admin policies for teachers table** (scoped by company)
3. **Add entity admin policies for students table** (scoped by company)
4. **Review and document edu_ table RLS strategy** (enable or disable consistently)

### 7.2 Short-Term Actions (Next 2 Weeks)

5. **Scope licenses table by company** (prevent cross-entity license viewing)
6. **Standardize inline admin checks** (use helper functions consistently)
7. **Add teacher → student access policies** (for classroom management)
8. **Review parent → student access** (ensure parents can only see their children)

### 7.3 Medium-Term Actions (Next Month)

9. **Document service role usage** (which edge functions use it and why)
10. **Review analytics table RLS** (determine if student data needs protection)
11. **Performance test policies** (ensure scoped queries are performant with proper indexes)
12. **Create RLS policy testing framework** (automated tests for each user type)

### 7.4 Documentation Actions

13. **Document RLS policy patterns** (standard templates for new tables)
14. **Create access control decision tree** (visual guide for developers)
15. **Maintain RLS policy inventory** (spreadsheet or automated tool)
16. **Update onboarding docs** (RLS considerations for new developers)

---

## 8. TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### 8.1 Test Matrix

Test each user type's access to:

| User Type | Tables to Test | Expected Access |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| System Admin | All tables | Full CRUD |
| Entity Admin (entity_admin) | teachers, students in company | Full CRUD in scope |
| Entity Admin (school_admin) | teachers, students in schools | Full CRUD in scope |
| Entity Admin (branch_admin) | teachers, students in branches | Full CRUD in scope |
| Teacher | students they teach | Read only (verify) |
| Teacher | other teachers | No access |
| Student | own student record | Read only |
| Student | other students | No access |
| Parent | linked students | Read only (verify) |

### 8.2 Negative Testing

Verify that users CANNOT:
- View data from other companies
- View data from other schools (if school-scoped)
- Modify data they don't own
- Bypass RLS through clever queries

### 8.3 Performance Testing

Test query performance with RLS policies on:
- Large student lists (10,000+ students)
- Entity admin queries with complex scopes
- Mock exam participant lists
- License availability checks

---

## 9. POLICY TEMPLATE LIBRARY

### 9.1 Self-Access Pattern
```sql
CREATE POLICY "table_name_self_access"
  ON table_name FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### 9.2 System Admin Full Access
```sql
CREATE POLICY "system_admins_manage_table_name"
  ON table_name FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()))
  WITH CHECK (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));
```

### 9.3 Entity Admin Scoped Access
```sql
CREATE POLICY "entity_admins_manage_table_name"
  ON table_name FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (
    company_id IN (
      SELECT company_id FROM entity_users
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND admin_level IN ('entity_admin', 'sub_entity_admin')
        AND is_active = true
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (/* same USING clause */);
```

### 9.4 Reference Table Pattern
```sql
CREATE POLICY "authenticated_users_read_table_name"
  ON table_name FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "system_admins_manage_table_name"
  ON table_name FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()))
  WITH CHECK (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));
```

### 9.5 Service Role Access
```sql
CREATE POLICY "service_role_full_access"
  ON table_name FOR ALL TO service_role
  USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

---

## 10. CONCLUSION

### Overall Security Posture: ✅ GOOD

The database security model is **well-designed and mostly correct**. The previous circular dependency issues have been resolved, and the helper function approach is sound.

**Key Strengths:**
- No tables with RLS enabled but missing policies
- Core authentication flow works correctly
- Helper functions properly use SECURITY DEFINER
- Mock exam system has comprehensive policies
- Multi-tenant hierarchy well-designed

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Student gamification data needs RLS protection
- Entity admin permissions need database-level policies
- Educational content RLS inconsistency
- Some policies use inconsistent approaches
- Teacher access to student data needs clarification

**Priority Actions:**
1. Enable RLS on student gamification tables (HIGH)
2. Add entity admin scoped policies (HIGH)
3. Standardize policy approaches (MEDIUM)
4. Review and test teacher → student access (MEDIUM)

### Estimated Effort to Address All Issues

- High Priority: **2-3 days**
- Medium Priority: **3-4 days**
- Low Priority: **1-2 days**
- Documentation: **2-3 days**

**Total:** ~10-12 days of focused security work
