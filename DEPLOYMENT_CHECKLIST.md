## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration (REQUIRED)

**Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard**
1. Log into Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to: SQL Editor
3. Open file: `supabase/migrations/20251003120000_fix_mock_exam_wizard_rls_policies.sql`
4. Copy entire contents
5. Paste into SQL Editor
6. Click "Run" button
7. Verify success message

**Option B: Using Supabase CLI** (if configured)
```bash
cd /path/to/project
supabase db push
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Run this query to verify helper functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname IN ('user_has_exam_access', 'is_system_admin');
-- Should return 2 rows

-- Verify policies were updated
SELECT policyname, tablename FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('mock_exam_stage_progress', 'mock_exam_instructions', 'mock_exam_questions');
-- Should show new policy names like "Entity users can view..."
```

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend Code

**Standard Deployment:**
1. Commit all changes to your repository
2. Push to your deployment branch (e.g., `main`, `production`)
3. Your CI/CD pipeline should automatically build and deploy

**Manual Deployment:**
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy the dist folder to your hosting service
# (Specific command depends on your hosting provider)
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Verification

**Immediate Checks (within 5 minutes):**
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] Can navigate to Mock Exams page
- [ ] Can open an existing mock exam
- [ ] "Change Status" button is clickable

**Functional Tests (within 15 minutes):**
1. **Test Status Change - Forward**
   - [ ] Open any exam in "Draft" status
   - [ ] Click "Change Status"
   - [ ] Wizard opens with loading indicator
   - [ ] Select "Planned" stage
   - [ ] Fill required fields
   - [ ] Click "Confirm transition"
   - [ ] Status updates successfully
   - [ ] No error messages

2. **Test Status Change - Backward**
   - [ ] Open exam in "Planned" status
   - [ ] Change back to "Draft"
   - [ ] Should allow backward transitions
   - [ ] Completed flag resets correctly

3. **Test Loading Behavior**
   - [ ] Open wizard for different exam
   - [ ] Loading spinner appears
   - [ ] Submit button disabled during load
   - [ ] Submit button enables after load
   - [ ] No "Unable to build payload" error

4. **Test Error Handling**
   - [ ] Try to open exam user doesn't have access to
   - [ ] Should see clear permission error
   - [ ] Console shows specific error logs

5. **Test Instructions & Questions**
   - [ ] Go to "Materials Ready" stage
   - [ ] Add/edit instructions for different audiences
   - [ ] Add questions from question bank
   - [ ] Add custom questions
   - [ ] Save and verify data persists

**Console Verification:**
Open browser DevTools → Console and verify logs:
```
✅ Should See:
[MockExamService] Fetching wizard context for exam: ...
[MockExamService] Exam data fetched successfully: ...
[MockExamService] Wizard context built successfully: {...}
[useMockExamStatusWizard] Successfully fetched wizard data
[Wizard] Building payload for stage: ...
[Wizard] Submitting payload: {...}

❌ Should NOT See:
"Unable to build status update payload"
[Wizard] Payload build failed: ...
[MockExamService] Error fetching exam data: ...
```

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Occur:

**Step 1: Revert Database Migration**
```sql
-- Restore original RLS policies
-- Use backup from: supabase/migrations/20251005220000_add_mock_exam_status_wizard_support.sql

-- Drop new helper functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS user_has_exam_access(uuid);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS is_system_admin();

-- Drop new policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Entity users can view stage progress" ON mock_exam_stage_progress;
-- (Continue for all new policies...)

-- Restore original policies
-- Copy policies from 20251005220000_add_mock_exam_status_wizard_support.sql
```

**Step 2: Revert Frontend Code**
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or roll back to specific commit
git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>
git push --force origin main
```

**Step 3: Clear Caches**
- Clear CDN cache (if using CDN)
- Ask users to hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
- Clear service worker caches if applicable

## Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

### Key Metrics to Watch:

1. **Error Rates**
   - Monitor for any spike in client-side errors
   - Check logs for "Unable to build payload" errors
   - Watch for RLS policy violation errors

2. **Performance**
   - Wizard open time should be ~1 second
   - Status transitions should complete in <2 seconds
   - No timeout errors

3. **User Feedback**
   - Monitor support tickets for wizard-related issues
   - Check for complaints about slow loading
   - Note any permission-related issues

### Monitoring Queries:

**Check RLS Policy Performance:**
```sql
-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query LIKE '%mock_exam%'
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Check Wizard Usage:**
```sql
-- Count status transitions
SELECT
  new_status,
  COUNT(*) as transitions,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (created_at - LAG(created_at) OVER (ORDER BY created_at)))) as avg_time_between
FROM mock_exam_status_history
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY new_status;
```
