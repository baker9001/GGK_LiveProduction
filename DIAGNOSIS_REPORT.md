# Login Failure - Complete Diagnostic Report

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Issue:** "Failed to retrieve user information. Please try again."
**Root Cause:** RLS policy column mismatch
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## The Critical Bug

**RLS policy blocked login queries because of column mismatch:**

- **Policy:** `USING (auth.uid() = id)` - Checks ID column
- **Query:** `.eq('email', normalizedEmail)` - Filters EMAIL column
- **Result:** No match → RLS blocks → Login fails ❌

---

## The Fix

**Added new RLS policy for email lookup:**

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own record by email"
  ON users FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (email = auth.email());
```

Now users can query by BOTH:
- ID: `WHERE id = auth.uid()` ✅
- Email: `WHERE email = auth.email()` ✅

## Status

- ✅ Migration applied: `20251001204848_fix_users_rls_email_lookup.sql`
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Ready for testing

**NEXT STEP: TEST ALL USER LOGINS IMMEDIATELY!**
