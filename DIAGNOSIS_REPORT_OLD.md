# System Admin Users Page - Full Diagnosis Report

## Executive Summary
After conducting a thorough analysis of the System Admin Users page, I've identified several critical issues in the user creation workflow, Supabase Auth integration, and data consistency. This report outlines the problems and provides comprehensive fixes.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Edge Function Integration Problems**
- **Issue**: The Edge Function `create-admin-user-auth` exists but has inconsistent error handling
- **Impact**: User creation may fail silently or with unclear error messages
- **Location**: `src/app/api/create-admin-user-auth/index.ts`

### 2. **Incomplete User Data Population**
- **Issue**: When creating users, not all required fields are populated in custom tables
- **Impact**: Missing data in `users`, `admin_users` tables leading to incomplete profiles
- **Location**: `src/app/system-admin/admin-users/tabs/UsersTab.tsx`

### 3. **Inconsistent Auth Flow**
- **Issue**: Mixed approach between direct database insertion and Supabase Auth
- **Impact**: Users may exist in auth.users but not in custom tables or vice versa
- **Location**: Multiple files in the auth workflow

### 4. **Missing Field Validation**
- **Issue**: Form validation doesn't cover all required database fields
- **Impact**: Database constraints may be violated during user creation
- **Location**: Form validation schemas

### 5. **Incomplete Role Assignment**
- **Issue**: Role permissions are not properly synced between roles table and user permissions
- **Impact**: Users may have incorrect or missing permissions
- **Location**: Roles management workflow
