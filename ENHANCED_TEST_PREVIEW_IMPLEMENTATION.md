## üîÑ Workflow Process

### Step 1: Review Initialization
1. User uploads questions via paper setup
2. System creates review session in database
3. Individual review status created for each question
4. Progress tracking initialized

### Step 2: Question Review
1. User expands each question to review
2. Views question text, answers, attachments, hints
3. Verifies all data is complete and correct
4. Clicks "Mark as Reviewed" button
5. Status saved to database with timestamp

### Step 3: Test Simulation (Optional/Required)
1. User starts test simulation
2. Takes test as a student would
3. System validates answers automatically
4. Calculates scores and provides feedback
5. Results saved for audit trail

### Step 4: Import Validation
1. System checks all questions reviewed
2. Verifies simulation completion if required
3. Validates minimum passing score (70%)
4. Enables import button when ready

### Step 5: Final Import
1. User confirms import
2. Questions inserted into production database
3. Review session marked complete
4. Audit trail preserved

## üîß Integration Points

### In QuestionsTab Component

To integrate the review workflow:

```typescript
import { QuestionImportReviewWorkflow } from './QuestionImportReviewWorkflow';

// In your component
<QuestionImportReviewWorkflow
  questions={processedQuestions}
  paperTitle={paperMetadata.title}
  paperDuration={paperMetadata.paper_duration}
  totalMarks={paperMetadata.total_marks}
  importSessionId={importSession?.id}
  requireSimulation={true} // or false for optional
  onAllQuestionsReviewed={() => {
    // Handle when all questions are reviewed
    console.log('All questions reviewed!');
  }}
  onImportReady={(canImport) => {
    // Enable/disable import button
    setCanImport(canImport);
  }}
/>
```

### Import Button Logic

```typescript
const [canImport, setCanImport] = useState(false);

// Import button should be disabled until canImport is true
<Button
  onClick={handleImportConfirm}
  disabled={!canImport || isImporting}
  variant="default"
>
  Confirm and Import Questions
</Button>
```

## üìä Database Queries

### Check Review Progress

```sql
SELECT
  review_session_id,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_reviewed) as reviewed,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE has_issues) as with_issues
FROM question_import_review_status
WHERE review_session_id = 'your-session-id'
GROUP BY review_session_id;
```

### Get Simulation Results

```sql
SELECT
  percentage,
  earned_marks,
  total_marks,
  passed,
  time_spent_seconds
FROM question_import_simulation_results
WHERE review_session_id = 'your-session-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Complete Review Session

```sql
SELECT complete_review_session('your-session-id');
```

## üéì Teacher Experience

### Before Testing (Traditional Approach)
1. Upload questions
2. Quick glance at data
3. Import directly
4. ‚ùå Potential quality issues
5. ‚ùå No validation process

### After Testing (Enhanced Approach)
1. Upload questions
2. Systematic review of each question
3. Interactive testing as students would see it
4. Automatic validation and scoring
5. Quality assurance confirmation
6. ‚úÖ Confidence in data quality
7. ‚úÖ Verified import readiness

## üîí Security Considerations

   - Batch validation runs

2. **Collaboration**
   - Multiple reviewers per session
   - Review assignment workflow

3. **Analytics**
   - Question difficulty analysis
   - Common validation issues
   - Import success rates

4. **Templates**
   - Review checklists
   - Validation rule sets
   - Quality standards

5. **AI Assistance**

## üìù Summary

This implementation transforms the question import process from a simple data transfer to a comprehensive quality assurance workflow. Teachers now have the tools to systematically review, test, and validate questions before they reach students, ensuring the highest quality educational content in the system.

The combination of manual review tracking, interactive simulation testing, and automatic validation creates a robust gatekeeper that maintains data integrity while providing teachers with confidence in their imported content.
