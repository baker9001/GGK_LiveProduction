## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Preparation (15 minutes)
**Before peak hours, low traffic time recommended**

```sql
-- 1.1 Backup current state
CREATE TABLE question_options_backup_20251018 AS
SELECT * FROM question_options;

-- 1.2 Check current data state
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_options,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE explanation IS NULL) as missing_explanation,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE context_type IS NULL) as missing_context
FROM question_options;

-- Record these numbers for comparison
```

### Step 2: Apply Database Migration (10 minutes)
```bash
# Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard
1. Navigate to Database > Migrations
2. Upload: 20251018173000_fix_question_options_complete_data_capture.sql
3. Review SQL
4. Click "Run Migration"
5. Verify success

# Option B: Via Supabase CLI
supabase db push
```

**Verify Migration Success:**
```sql
-- Check text column is removed
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'question_options' AND column_name = 'text';
-- Should return 0 rows

-- Check constraints exist
SELECT constraint_name FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE table_name = 'question_options'
AND constraint_name LIKE 'check_%';
-- Should return 3 constraints

-- Check indexes created
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'question_options'
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_question_options_%';
-- Should return 5 indexes
```

### Step 3: Deploy Application Code (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Resolve MCQ option data loss - capture all fields

- Add database migration with constraints and indexes
- Enhance import code to populate explanation, context, image fields
- Add pre-import validation to prevent future data loss
- Create backfill script to recover lost data
- Add comprehensive monitoring and quality views

Fixes: Critical data loss affecting 53% of option metadata
Impact: Educational value improved, analytics enabled
"

# 2. Push to staging
git push origin staging

# 3. Test on staging (see Step 4)

# 4. Deploy to production
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Staging Tests (20 minutes)
**Do NOT skip these tests**

#### Test 1: Import With Basic Options
```json
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question_number": "TEST1",
  "question_text": "Test question?",
  "topic": "Testing",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "figure": false,
  "attachments": [],
  "marks": 1,
  "options": [
    {"label": "A", "text": "Option A"},
    {"label": "B", "text": "Option B"},
    {"label": "C", "text": "Option C"},
    {"label": "D", "text": "Option D"}
  ],
  "correct_answer": "B"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Import succeeds
- ✅ 4 options stored
- ✅ Validation warns: "Missing explanations"
- ✅ All basic fields populated

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT label, option_text, is_correct, explanation
FROM question_options qo
JOIN questions_master_admin q ON q.id = qo.question_id
WHERE q.question_number = 'TEST1'
ORDER BY qo.order;
```

#### Test 2: Import With Complete Options
```json
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question_number": "TEST2",
  "question_text": "Which organelle synthesizes proteins?",
  "topic": "Cell Biology",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "figure": false,
  "attachments": [],
  "marks": 1,
  "options": [
    {
      "label": "A",
      "text": "mitochondrion",
      "explanation": "Incorrect. Mitochondria produce ATP through cellular respiration, not proteins.",
      "is_correct": false,
      "context": {
        "type": "organelle_function",
        "value": "energy_production",
        "label": "Energy Production"
      }
    },
    {
      "label": "B",
      "text": "ribosome",
      "explanation": "Correct! Ribosomes are the organelles responsible for protein synthesis. They translate mRNA into amino acid sequences.",
      "is_correct": true,
      "context": {
        "type": "organelle_function",
        "value": "protein_synthesis",
        "label": "Protein Synthesis"
      }
    }
  ],
  "correct_answer": "B"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Import succeeds
- ✅ All 14 fields populated per option
- ✅ Validation shows 100% completeness
- ✅ Console logs: "All options have complete data"

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT
  label,
  option_text,
  is_correct,
  explanation IS NOT NULL as has_explanation,
  context_type IS NOT NULL as has_context,
  length(explanation) as explanation_length
FROM question_options qo
JOIN questions_master_admin q ON q.id = qo.question_id
WHERE q.question_number = 'TEST2'
ORDER BY qo.order;
```

#### Test 3: Validation Catches Errors
Try importing MCQ with missing label:
```json
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "options": [
    {"text": "Option without label"}
  ]
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- ❌ Validation error logged
- ⚠️ Console shows: "Missing required 'label' field"
- ✅ Import continues with warnings

### Step 5: Run Data Backfill (30 minutes)
**After successful deployment and testing**

```sql
-- 5.1 Record baseline
CREATE TABLE backfill_metrics_before AS
SELECT * FROM question_options_completeness_stats;

-- 5.2 Execute backfill
SELECT * FROM backfill_question_options_from_imports();

-- Expected output example:
-- total_options_processed | options_with_new_explanation | options_with_new_context | options_unchanged | errors
-- -----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|--------
--                   2000 |                         1200 |                     1500 |               300 |       0

-- 5.3 Record results
CREATE TABLE backfill_metrics_after AS
SELECT * FROM question_options_completeness_stats;

-- 5.4 Compare improvement
SELECT
  'BEFORE' as timing,
  explanation_completion_pct,
  context_completion_pct
FROM backfill_metrics_before
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'AFTER' as timing,
  explanation_completion_pct,
  context_completion_pct
FROM backfill_metrics_after;
```

### Step 6: Post-Deployment Verification (10 minutes)

#### Verify Database State
```sql
-- Check completeness improved
SELECT * FROM question_options_completeness_stats;

-- Target metrics:
-- explanation_completion_pct > 70%
-- context_completion_pct > 80%

-- Check backfill success rate
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_backfilled,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE success = true) as successful,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE success = true) / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM question_options_backfill_log;
```

#### Verify Application Behavior
- [ ] Import new MCQ paper
- [ ] Check console logs show validation results
- [ ] Verify all option fields captured
- [ ] Check no errors in browser console
- [ ] Confirm data completeness warnings appear when appropriate

#### Monitor for Issues
```sql
-- Check for any failed imports after deployment
SELECT
  import_session_id,
  status,
  metadata
FROM past_paper_import_sessions
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 hour'
AND status = 'failed';
```

---

## Rollback Procedure

**If critical issues detected within 2 hours of deployment:**

### Step 1: Database Rollback
```sql
-- Restore from backup
DELETE FROM question_options;
INSERT INTO question_options SELECT * FROM question_options_backup_20251018;

-- Restore text column
ALTER TABLE question_options ADD COLUMN text text;
UPDATE question_options SET text = option_text;

-- Remove new constraints
ALTER TABLE question_options
  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS check_option_text_not_empty,
  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS check_option_label_format,
  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS check_option_parent_exists;
```

### Step 2: Code Rollback
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Notify Team
- Post in #engineering channel
- Update status page
- Document issue for post-mortem
