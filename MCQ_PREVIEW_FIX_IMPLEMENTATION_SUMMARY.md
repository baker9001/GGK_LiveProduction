# MCQ Preview Fix Implementation Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the Past Papers Import Wizard "Preview & Test" feature where MCQ questions were not displaying answer options (A, B, C, D) to admin users during the test simulation preview. Previously, the preview showed only the correct answer letter without the actual options, making it impossible for admins to verify how students would see the questions.

## Root Cause
The ExamSimulation component was passing `mode='admin'` to DynamicAnswerField when `isQAMode` was true. In admin mode, DynamicAnswerField displayed the correct answers editor interface instead of rendering the MCQ options, preventing admins from seeing the student view.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New 'qa_preview' Mode
**File:** `src/components/shared/DynamicAnswerField.tsx`

- Added new mode type: `'qa_preview'` to the mode union type
- This mode renders MCQ options exactly as students see them (A, B, C, D with full text)
- Simultaneously displays comprehensive teacher review panel below the options
- Maintains separation between editing mode (admin) and preview mode (qa_preview)

### 2. Enhanced MCQ Rendering in QA Preview Mode
**File:** `src/components/shared/DynamicAnswerField.tsx`

#### Features Added:
- **MCQ Options Display**: All options (A, B, C, D) rendered with proper labels and full text
- **Teacher Review Panel**: Comprehensive marking guidance displayed below options including:
  - Correct answer identification with option labels and text
  - Mark scheme abbreviation badges (OWTTE, ORA, ECF, etc.)
  - Answer variations display (alternative phrasings, reverse arguments, mathematical expressions)
  - Equivalent variations and synonym mappings
  - Answer requirements and expectations
  - Total alternatives count

### 3. Updated ExamSimulation Component
**File:** `src/app/system-admin/learning/practice-management/questions-setup/components/ExamSimulation.tsx`

Changed all instances where `mode` is passed to DynamicAnswerField:
- **Before:** `mode={isQAMode ? 'admin' : examMode}`
- **After:** `mode={isQAMode ? 'qa_preview' : examMode}`

Updated for:
- Main questions (line 1217)
- Question parts (line 1301)
- Question subparts (line 1366)

### 4. Enhanced CorrectAnswer Type Definition
**File:** `src/components/shared/DynamicAnswerField.tsx`

Extended the CorrectAnswer interface to support all extraction guide requirements:

```typescript
interface CorrectAnswer {
  // Existing fields
  answer: string;
  marks?: number;
  alternative_id?: number;
  linked_alternatives?: number[];
  alternative_type?: string;
  context?: { type: string; value: string; label?: string };
  unit?: string;
  measurement_details?: Record<string, unknown> | null;
  accepts_equivalent_phrasing?: boolean;
  error_carried_forward?: boolean;

  // New fields for extraction guide compliance
  accepts_reverse_argument?: boolean;
  answer_requirement?: string;
  total_alternatives?: number;
  validation_issues?: string[];
  equivalent_variations?: string[];
  answer_variations?: {
    alternative_phrasings?: string[];
    reverse_arguments?: string[];
    mathematical_expressions?: string[];
    simplified_forms?: string[];
  };
  synonym_mappings?: Record<string, string[]>;
  marking_flags?: {
    accepts_reverse_argument?: boolean;
    accepts_equivalent_phrasing?: boolean;
    accepts_mathematical_notation?: boolean;
    case_insensitive?: boolean;
    accepts_abbreviated_forms?: boolean;
    ignore_articles?: boolean;
    accepts_symbolic_notation?: boolean;
  };
}
```

### 5. Mark Scheme Abbreviation Badges
**File:** `src/components/shared/DynamicAnswerField.tsx`

Created `renderMarkSchemeBadges()` helper function that displays:
- **OWTTE** (Or Words To That Effect) - Blue badge
- **ORA** (Or Reverse Argument) - Purple badge
- **ECF** (Error Carried Forward) - Green badge
- **Math notation OK** - Indigo badge (for mathematical_notation flag)
- **Unit indicators** - Teal badge (displays required units)

### 6. Answer Variations Display System
**File:** `src/components/shared/DynamicAnswerField.tsx`

Implemented comprehensive variation display in QA preview mode:

#### Alternative Phrasings
Shows all acceptable ways to phrase the answer with amber-colored badges

#### Reverse Arguments
Displays acceptable reverse formulations with purple-colored badges

#### Mathematical Expressions
Shows equivalent math notations with indigo-colored badges and monospace font

#### Equivalent Variations
Lists other acceptable answer forms with blue-colored badges

## Bug Fixes Applied

### White Screen Error Fix (Critical)
**Issue:** When clicking "Preview & Test", a white page appeared with console error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')
at DynamicAnswerField.tsx:1360
```

**Root Cause:** In the QA preview teacher insights panel, the code attempted to find the correct MCQ option by checking if `ans.answer.includes(opt.label)`, but `opt.label` could be undefined, causing the error.

**Fix Applied:** Added null/undefined checks before calling `.includes()`:
```typescript
// Before (line 1360)
opt.is_correct || ans.answer.includes(opt.label)

// After
opt.is_correct || (opt.label && ans.answer && ans.answer.includes(opt.label))
```

This ensures that both `opt.label` and `ans.answer` exist before attempting string comparison, preventing the TypeError and white screen.

## Summary
The MCQ preview issue has been completely resolved. Admin users can now use the "Preview & Test" button in the Past Papers Import Wizard to see exactly how MCQ questions will appear to students, with all answer options (A, B, C, D) fully displayed. Additionally, a comprehensive teacher review panel provides complete marking guidance, answer variations, and mark scheme indicators to ensure data accuracy before importing questions to the database.

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility, follows all extraction guide requirements, and provides a foundation for future enhancements including conditional marking, cross-question dependencies, and exam board-specific adaptations.
