## 📚 Developer Documentation

### Using the MultiStepWizard Component

```typescript
import { MultiStepWizard, WizardStep } from '@/components/shared/MultiStepWizard';

const steps: WizardStep[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    title: 'Basic Info',
    description: 'Enter basic details',
    estimatedMinutes: 2,
    isOptional: false,
  },
  // ... more steps
];

<MultiStepWizard
  steps={steps}
  currentStep={currentStep}
  onStepChange={setCurrentStep}
  onComplete={handleComplete}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
  canGoNext={validateCurrentStep()}
  completedSteps={completedSteps}
  autoSave={true}
>
  {/* Step content here */}
</MultiStepWizard>
```

### Using the Validation System

```typescript
import {
  validateExamTitle,
  validateDuration,
  validateMockExamForm,
} from '@/lib/validation/mockExamValidation';

// Single field validation
const titleResult = validateExamTitle(formData.title);
if (!titleResult.isValid) {
  console.error(titleResult.error);
}
if (titleResult.warning) {
  console.warn(titleResult.warning);
}

// Full form validation
const results = validateMockExamForm(formData);
const hasErrors = hasValidationErrors(results);
```

### Extending the Wizard

To add a new step:

1. Add step definition to `WIZARD_STEPS` array
2. Add validation case in `validateStep` function
3. Add step content in render switch statement
4. Update `completedSteps` logic if needed
