# Phone Number Save Issue - Quick Fix Summary

## The Problem
Contact numbers show success message but don't save to database.

## Root Cause
RLS policy on students table was blocking UPDATE operations due to user ID mismatch.

## The Fix

### Step 1: Apply Migration
The migration file has been created:
```
supabase/migrations/20251006160000_fix_student_update_rls_policy.sql
```

This migration will be automatically applied when you push to the database.

### Step 2: Verify in Console
After the fix, when saving phone numbers, check browser console (F12):

**BEFORE FIX** (Bad):
```
[StudentProfile] Update result: []  ← No rows updated!
[StudentProfile] Rows affected: 0   ← Phone not saved!
```

**AFTER FIX** (Good):
```
[StudentProfile] Update result: [{ id: "...", phone: "+965 12345678", ... }]
[StudentProfile] Rows affected: 1   ← Phone saved successfully!
```

### Step 3: Test
1. Login as a student
2. Go to profile page
3. Enter phone number: "12345678"
4. Click Save
5. Refresh page
6. Phone number should persist: "+965 12345678"

## What Changed

**Before** (Incorrect):
```sql
-- This compared different UUID types:
USING (user_id = get_effective_user_id())
```

**After** (Correct):
```sql
-- This properly looks up through users table:
USING (
  user_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM users WHERE auth_user_id = get_effective_user_id()
  )
)
```

## Why It Failed Silently

RLS policies don't raise errors when they block operations - they just prevent rows from being affected. The application query succeeded (no error), but 0 rows were updated (blocked by policy), so the success message showed even though nothing was saved.

## Technical Details

**The Relationship Chain**:
```
students.user_id → users.id → users.auth_user_id → auth.uid()
```

**The Problem**:
- `get_effective_user_id()` returns `auth.uid()`
- `students.user_id` stores `users.id`
- These are different UUIDs
- Policy evaluated to FALSE
- UPDATE blocked silently

**The Solution**:
- Look up `users.id` where `users.auth_user_id = get_effective_user_id()`
- Match against `students.user_id`
- Policy now evaluates to TRUE
- UPDATE succeeds

## All Fixed Issues

✅ Phone numbers now save correctly
✅ Empty phone numbers save as NULL
✅ Country codes are preserved
✅ Long international numbers supported (varchar 50)
✅ Console logs show detailed debugging info
✅ Error messages improved for RLS issues
