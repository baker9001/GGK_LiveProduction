# Question Import Data Integrity - Fixes Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Implementation Status:** Priority 1 Fixes COMPLETED

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Priority 1 (P1) fixes identified in the comprehensive audit report. All critical data integrity gaps have been addressed, ensuring complete data population during the question import process.

---

## Fixes Implemented

### ✅ Fix #1: Applied Missing `figure_required` Column

**Problem:** Migration file existed but column was not present in production database.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created new migration: `fix_missing_figure_required_column.sql`
- Added `figure_required` column to `questions_master_admin` table
- Added `figure_required` column to `sub_questions` table
- Created performance indexes for figure filtering
- Added comprehensive column comments

**Database Changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE questions_master_admin
ADD COLUMN figure_required boolean DEFAULT true NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE sub_questions
ADD COLUMN figure_required boolean DEFAULT true NOT NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_questions_master_admin_figure_required
  ON questions_master_admin(figure_required) WHERE figure_required = true;

CREATE INDEX idx_sub_questions_figure_required
  ON sub_questions(figure_required) WHERE figure_required = true;
```

**Code Changes:**
- Updated `questionsDataOperations.ts` to populate `figure_required` field during import
- Integrated `requiresFigure()` helper function to auto-detect figure requirements
- Applied to both main questions and sub-questions

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/fix_missing_figure_required_column.sql` (NEW)
- `src/lib/data-operations/questionsDataOperations.ts`

**Impact:** Questions can now track whether figure attachments are mandatory, enabling proper validation during QA review.

---

### ✅ Fix #2: Populated Audit Trail Fields (created_by, updated_by, updated_at)

**Problem:** Questions imported with NULL values for creator and updater tracking.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Retrieved authenticated user session during import process
- Populated `created_by` field with current user ID
- Populated `updated_by` field with current user ID
- Set explicit `updated_at` timestamp

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Get authenticated user ID for audit fields
const { data: { session }, error: sessionError } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
const currentUserId = session?.user?.id || null;

const questionData = {
  // ... existing fields
  created_by: currentUserId,
  updated_by: currentUserId,
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/data-operations/questionsDataOperations.ts`

**Impact:** Full audit trail now maintained for all imported questions, enabling accountability and tracking.

---

### ✅ Fix #3: Set `figure_file_id` for Primary Attachments

**Problem:** `figure_file_id` column existed but always remained NULL, making it impossible to identify the primary figure attachment.

**Solution Implemented:**
- After inserting attachments, capture the first attachment ID
- Update the question record to set `figure_file_id` to the primary attachment
- Only applies to questions where `question.figure` is true

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
const { data: insertedAttachments, error: attachError } = await supabase
  .from('questions_attachments')
  .insert(attachmentsToInsert)
  .select();

// Set figure_file_id to first attachment if question has figure
if (insertedAttachments && insertedAttachments.length > 0 && question.figure) {
  await supabase
    .from('questions_master_admin')
    .update({ figure_file_id: insertedAttachments[0].id })
    .eq('id', insertedQuestion.id);
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/data-operations/questionsDataOperations.ts`

**Impact:** UI can now reliably identify and display the primary figure attachment for each question.

---

### ✅ Fix #4: Populated Attachment Audit Fields

**Problem:** `uploaded_by` and `uploaded_at` fields in `questions_attachments` table were never populated.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Retrieved authenticated user session once per batch
- Added `uploaded_by` and `uploaded_at` to all attachment insertions
- Applied to both main question attachments and sub-question attachments

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// For main question attachments
const attachmentsToInsert = questionAttachments.map((att: any) => ({
  question_id: insertedQuestion.id,
  file_url: att.file_url,
  file_name: att.file_name || att.fileName,
  file_type: att.file_type || 'image/png',
  file_size: att.file_size || 0,
  // P1 FIX: Populate attachment audit fields
  uploaded_by: currentUserId,
  uploaded_at: new Date().toISOString()
}));

// For sub-question attachments
const { data: { session: currentSession } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
const attachmentUserId = currentSession?.user?.id || null;

const attachmentsToInsert = partAttachments.map((att: any) => ({
  sub_question_id: subQuestionRecord.id,
  // ... other fields
  uploaded_by: attachmentUserId,
  uploaded_at: new Date().toISOString()
}));
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/data-operations/questionsDataOperations.ts`

**Impact:** Complete audit trail for all file attachments, enabling tracking of who uploaded which files.

## Remaining Gaps (For Future Implementation)

### Priority 2 Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **QA Workflow Fields** - Still require manual UI implementation:
   - `is_confirmed`, `confirmed_at`, `confirmed_by`
   - `qa_notes`, `qa_reviewed_at`, `qa_reviewed_by`
   - `confidence_level`

2. **Context Metadata System** - Advanced marking not integrated:
   - `context_metadata` (still defaults to `{}`)
   - `has_context_structure` (still false)
   - `context_extraction_status` (still 'pending')
   - `answer_components` table (still unused)
   - `answer_requirements` table (still unused)

3. **Junction Table Consistency** - Primary topics/subtopics not in junction tables:
   - `question_topics` - only contains additional topics
   - `question_subtopics` - only contains additional subtopics

4. **Question Options Context** - Missing MCQ metadata:
   - `image_id`, `explanation`, `context_type`, `context_value`, `context_label`

5. **Other Missing Fields**:
   - `tags` array (never populated)
   - `sort_order` (always defaults to 0)
   - Soft delete fields (`deleted_at`, `deleted_by`)

### Estimated Effort for P2 Enhancements

- QA Workflow Implementation: 8 hours
- Context Extraction Integration: 12 hours
- Junction Table Consistency: 4 hours
- Question Options Enhancement: 2 hours

**Total P2 Effort:** ~26 hours
