# Question Import Fix - Complete Resolution

## Problem Summary

Questions appeared to import (progress bar moved through all 40 questions) but no data was saved to the database. Error message appeared:
```
Failed to import questions:
Question 1: Cannot access 'Rt' before initialization
Question 2: Cannot access 'Rt' before initialization
...
```

## Root Cause

The error "Cannot access 'Rt' before initialization" was caused by the Toast component trying to access `react-hot-toast` functions (`hotToast.promise` and `hotToast.custom`) at module load time, before the library was fully initialized.

## Solution Applied

Modified `/tmp/cc-agent/54326970/project/src/components/shared/Toast.tsx` to wrap the problematic function references in arrow functions for lazy evaluation:

```typescript
export const toast = {
  success: (message: string, options?: ToastShowOptions) => showToast('success', message, options),
  error: (message: string, options?: ToastShowOptions) => showToast('error', message, options),
  info: (message: string, options?: ToastShowOptions) => showToast('info', message, options),
  warning: (message: string, options?: ToastShowOptions) => showToast('warning', message, options),
  loading: (message: string, options?: ToastShowOptions) => showToast('loading', message, options),
  // Fix: Wrap in arrow function to avoid "Cannot access 'Rt' before initialization" error
  promise: (...args: Parameters<typeof hotToast.promise>) => hotToast.promise(...args),
  dismiss: (id?: string | number) => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      clearToastTimeout(id);
    }
    return hotToast.dismiss(id);
  },
  // Fix: Wrap in arrow function to avoid "Cannot access 'Rt' before initialization" error
  custom: (...args: Parameters<typeof hotToast.custom>) => hotToast.custom(...args),
};
```

## What This Fix Does
- **Before**: `hotToast.promise` and `hotToast.custom` were accessed immediately when the module loaded, causing initialization errors
- **After**: These functions are now accessed only when actually called, ensuring `hotToast` is fully initialized first

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
```bash
# In your browser:
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

### 2. Test Question Import
1. Navigate to System Admin → Learning → Practice Management → Papers Setup
2. Select a paper with questions to import
3. Go to the Questions tab
4. Click "Import Questions"
5. Monitor the import progress

### 3. Verify Success
After import completes, check:
- No "Cannot access 'Rt' before initialization" errors appear
- Success toast appears showing number of questions imported
- Questions are visible in the Questions Setup page
- Database tables contain the imported data:
  - `questions_master_admin`
  - `question_options` (for MCQ options)
  - `question_correct_answers`
  - `questions_attachments` (if any)

### 4. Database Verification Query
```sql
-- Check recently imported questions
SELECT
  qma.id,
  qma.question_number,
  qma.question_description,
  qma.created_at,
  COUNT(DISTINCT qo.id) as option_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT qca.id) as answer_count
FROM questions_master_admin qma
LEFT JOIN question_options qo ON qo.question_id = qma.id
LEFT JOIN question_correct_answers qca ON qca.question_id = qma.id
WHERE qma.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY qma.id, qma.question_number, qma.question_description, qma.created_at
ORDER BY qma.created_at DESC;
```

## Additional Diagnostic Tools Available
If you encounter any issues, the following diagnostic functions are available:

```sql
-- Check if you can import questions
SELECT * FROM can_insert_questions();

-- Check prerequisites for a specific paper
SELECT * FROM validate_question_import_prerequisites(
  'paper-uuid-here',
  'data-structure-uuid-here'
);

-- Test overall import permissions
SELECT * FROM test_question_insert_permission();
```

## Expected Results
- ✅ Question import completes without errors
- ✅ All questions are saved to database
- ✅ Toast notifications work correctly
- ✅ Progress tracking shows accurate counts
- ✅ Import session logs show success status

## User Information
- **Test User**: baker@ggknowledge.com
- **User Type**: System Admin
- **Permissions**: Verified admin access with proper RLS policies

## Technical Notes
- Fix applies to all toast usage across the application
- No database changes required - issue was frontend only
- RLS policies and permissions were already correct
- Import session tracking continues to work as designed
