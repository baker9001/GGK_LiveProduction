# Reference Materials Display Fix - Summary

## Issue
The "Reference Materials:" card was displaying "Failed to load image" error even when questions had no actual figures or attachments. This occurred because:

1. Questions had attachment records with empty or invalid `file_url` values
2. The `AttachmentGallery` component displayed the section header whenever attachments array existed, regardless of content validity
3. Empty attachment records were being rendered, causing image loading errors

## Root Cause
- Attachments array contained records with no valid `file_url`
- Component didn't validate attachment data before rendering
- "Reference Materials:" section appeared even when no displayable content existed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. AttachmentGallery Component Enhancement
**File:** `src/components/shared/UnifiedTestSimulation.tsx`

Added validation logic to filter attachments before rendering:

```typescript
// Filter out attachments with no valid file_url or empty URLs
const validAttachments = attachments.filter(attachment => {
  const hasValidUrl = attachment.file_url && attachment.file_url.trim() !== '';
  const isDescriptionOnly = !hasValidUrl && attachment.file_type === 'text/description';

  // Keep description-only attachments (placeholders) in QA mode
  // But filter out completely invalid/empty attachments
  return hasValidUrl || isDescriptionOnly;
});

// If no valid attachments remain after filtering, don't render anything
if (validAttachments.length === 0) {
  return null;
}
```

### 2. Applied Same Fix to ExamSimulation Component
**File:** `src/app/system-admin/learning/practice-management/questions-setup/components/ExamSimulation.tsx`

Applied identical validation logic to maintain consistency across both simulation components.

## Benefits

1. **No False Errors:** Questions without attachments no longer show "Failed to load image" errors
2. **Clean UI:** "Reference Materials:" section only appears when there are valid attachments to display
3. **Preserved Functionality:** Description-only placeholders (for QA mode) are still displayed when intentionally added
4. **Better UX:** Students and teachers see cleaner, more accurate question displays

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Questions with no attachments:** Verify "Reference Materials:" section doesn't appear
2. **Questions with valid images:** Verify images display correctly
3. **Questions with empty attachment records:** Verify section is hidden
4. **QA mode with placeholders:** Verify placeholder warnings still display when attachment has description but no file
5. **Mixed scenarios:** Questions with both valid and invalid attachments should only show valid ones

## Technical Details

- **Components Modified:** 2
- **Validation Added:** Pre-render filtering of attachment arrays
- **Backward Compatible:** Yes, existing valid attachments display normally
- **Build Status:** âœ“ Successful
