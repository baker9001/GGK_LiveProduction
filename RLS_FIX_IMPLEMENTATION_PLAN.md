### Issue H4: Educational Content RLS Consistency

**Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM - Inconsistent security model
**Impact:** Unclear whether edu content is public or restricted
**Affected Tables:** edu_units, edu_topics, edu_subtopics, edu_learning_objectives, edu_specific_concepts

**Decision Required:** Choose approach:
1. **Option A:** Enable RLS (content is restricted/premium)
2. **Option B:** Disable RLS on edu_subjects (all content is public)

**Recommended:** Option B - Make all educational content publicly readable

**Migration File:** `standardize_educational_content_rls.sql`

```sql
/*
  # Standardize Educational Content RLS

  ## Priority: MEDIUM - Consistency

  ## Decision: Make all educational content publicly readable

  ## Changes:
  1. Disable RLS on edu_subjects (to match other edu tables)
  2. Document that edu content is public reference data

  ## Rationale:
  - Educational content (subjects, units, topics) is reference data
  - All users need access for dropdowns, filters, learning paths
  - No sensitive data in these tables
  - Consistent with other reference tables (regions, programs, providers)
*/

-- Disable RLS on edu_subjects to match other edu tables
ALTER TABLE edu_subjects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view edu_subjects" ON edu_subjects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System admins can manage edu_subjects" ON edu_subjects;

-- Document decision
COMMENT ON TABLE edu_subjects IS 'Educational subjects - Public reference data accessible to all users';
COMMENT ON TABLE edu_units IS 'Educational units - Public reference data accessible to all users';
COMMENT ON TABLE edu_topics IS 'Educational topics - Public reference data accessible to all users';
COMMENT ON TABLE edu_subtopics IS 'Educational subtopics - Public reference data accessible to all users';
COMMENT ON TABLE edu_learning_objectives IS 'Learning objectives - Public reference data accessible to all users';
COMMENT ON TABLE edu_specific_concepts IS 'Specific concepts - Public reference data accessible to all users';

-- Note: If future requirements change and content becomes premium/restricted,
-- re-enable RLS and add appropriate policies
```

**Alternative: If content should be restricted (Option A)**

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all edu tables
ALTER TABLE edu_units ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE edu_topics ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE edu_subtopics ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE edu_learning_objectives ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE edu_specific_concepts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add policies to all tables (repeat for each)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view edu content"
  ON edu_units FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "System admins can manage edu content"
  ON edu_units FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()))
  WITH CHECK (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));
```

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] All users can access edu content for dropdowns
- [ ] Application features using edu content work correctly
- [ ] System admins can still manage content (via UI or service role)

## PHASE 2: MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES (3-4 Days)

### Issue M1: Scope Licenses Table by Company

**Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM - Cross-entity data exposure
**Impact:** Users can see licenses not assigned to their entity
**Affected Tables:** licenses

**Migration File:** `scope_licenses_by_company.sql`

```sql
/*
  # Scope Licenses Table by Company

  ## Priority: MEDIUM - Data Isolation

  ## Changes:
  1. Replace overly permissive "view all" policy
  2. Add company-scoped viewing policy
  3. Maintain system admin full access

  ## Security:
  - Entity users only see licenses for their company
  - Teachers see licenses for their company
  - Students see licenses for their company
  - System admins see all licenses
*/

-- Drop overly permissive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view licenses" ON licenses;

-- Add company-scoped policy
CREATE POLICY "Users view licenses in their company"
  ON licenses FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- System admins see all
    is_admin_user(auth.uid())
    OR
    -- Entity users see company licenses
    company_id IN (
      SELECT company_id FROM entity_users WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
    OR
    -- Teachers see company licenses
    company_id IN (
      SELECT company_id FROM teachers WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
    OR
    -- Students see company licenses
    company_id IN (
      SELECT company_id FROM students WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- System admin management policy already exists, keep it
```

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Entity admin sees only their company's licenses
- [ ] Teacher sees only their company's licenses
- [ ] Student sees only their company's licenses
- [ ] System admin sees all licenses
- [ ] User from Company A cannot see Company B licenses

### Issue M2: Standardize Admin Check Functions

**Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¢ LOW - Code quality/maintainability
**Impact:** Inconsistent patterns make code harder to maintain
**Affected Tables:** schools, branches

**Migration File:** `standardize_admin_check_functions.sql`

```sql
/*
  # Standardize Admin Check Functions

  ## Priority: MEDIUM - Code Quality

  ## Changes:
  1. Replace inline admin checks with helper functions
  2. Ensure consistency across all policies

  ## Benefits:
  - Consistent pattern across all tables
  - Easier to maintain
  - Better performance (function can be optimized once)
*/

-- Schools table: Replace inline checks
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System admins can view all schools" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System admins can update all schools" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System admins can delete schools" ON schools;

-- Recreate with helper function
CREATE POLICY "System admins can view all schools"
  ON schools FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "System admins can update all schools"
  ON schools FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()))
  WITH CHECK (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "System admins can delete schools"
  ON schools FOR DELETE TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));

-- Branches table: Replace inline checks
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System admins can view all branches" ON branches;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System admins can update all branches" ON branches;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System admins can delete branches" ON branches;

-- Recreate with helper function
CREATE POLICY "System admins can view all branches"
  ON branches FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "System admins can update all branches"
  ON branches FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()))
  WITH CHECK (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "System admins can delete branches"
  ON branches FOR DELETE TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));
```

### Issue M3: Teacher Access to Student Data

**Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM - Business functionality
**Impact:** Teachers may need to view student lists for their classes
**Affected Tables:** students

**Requires:** Application code review to understand teacher-student relationships

**Migration File:** `add_teacher_student_access.sql`

```sql
/*
  # Add Teacher Access to Student Data

  ## Priority: MEDIUM - Classroom Management

  ## Changes:
  1. Add policy for teachers to view students they teach
  2. Use teacher_sections junction table to determine relationships

  ## Security:
  - Teachers can only view students in their assigned sections
  - Teachers cannot modify student records
  - Read-only access for classroom management
*/

-- Teachers can view students in their assigned sections
CREATE POLICY "Teachers view students in their sections"
  ON students FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (
    is_teacher(auth.uid())
    AND id IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT s.id
      FROM students s
      JOIN class_sections cs ON cs.id = s.class_section_id
      JOIN teacher_sections ts ON ts.class_section_id = cs.id
      JOIN teachers t ON t.id = ts.teacher_id
      WHERE t.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND t.is_active = true
    )
  );

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_students_class_section_id
  ON students(class_section_id);
```

**Note:** Review application code to confirm this is the correct relationship pattern.

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Teacher can view students in their assigned sections
- [ ] Teacher cannot view students in other sections
- [ ] Teacher cannot modify student records
- [ ] Query performs well with indexes

---

## PHASE 3: LOW PRIORITY & DOCUMENTATION (3-4 Days)

### Task L1: Document Service Role Usage

**File:** `SERVICE_ROLE_DOCUMENTATION.md`

Document which edge functions use service role and why:
- User creation functions
- Email sending functions
- Migration functions
- Audit log functions

### Task L2: Review Answer Analytics RLS

Determine if these tables contain student-specific data:
- answer_analytics
- exam_answers_extended

If yes, enable RLS and add appropriate policies.

### Task L3: Create RLS Testing Framework

Create automated tests for each user type:

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('RLS Policies - Students', () => {
  it('student can view own record', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('student cannot view other students', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('student can view own achievements', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Task L4: Performance Test RLS Policies

Test query performance with:
- 10,000+ students
- 100+ schools
- Complex scoped queries

Monitor and optimize slow queries.

### Task L5: Update Documentation

- Document RLS policy patterns
- Create developer onboarding guide
- Update schema documentation
- Create RLS decision tree
