# Subject Logo Upload Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified

System admin users were unable to upload subject logos, receiving the error:
**"new row violates row-level security policy"**

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by improperly configured Row-Level Security (RLS) policies on the `edu_subjects` table:

1. **Single "FOR ALL" Policy**: The original policy used `FOR ALL` which combines SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations into one policy
2. **UPDATE Operation Failure**: When PostgreSQL evaluates UPDATE operations with a `FOR ALL` policy, it checks the `USING` clause first to verify the row can be accessed
3. **Access Check Blocking Update**: The `USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()))` check was preventing the UPDATE operation from proceeding

### Technical Details

**Original Policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "System admins can manage edu_subjects"
  ON edu_subjects FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()))
  WITH CHECK (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));
```

**Why it Failed:**
- For UPDATE operations, PostgreSQL first evaluates `USING` to check if the user can see the row
- If `USING` returns false or encounters an issue, the UPDATE is blocked before it even attempts to modify the row
- The `FOR ALL` policy was too broad and didn't properly separate the access patterns for different operations

## Solution Implemented

Created a new migration: `fix_edu_subjects_rls_for_logo_upload.sql`

### Changes Made

1. **Dropped the problematic "FOR ALL" policy**
2. **Created explicit, separate policies for each operation:**

   - **SELECT Policy** (for all authenticated users):
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view edu_subjects"
       ON edu_subjects FOR SELECT
       TO authenticated
       USING (true);
     ```

   - **INSERT Policy** (for system admins only):
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "System admins can insert edu_subjects"
       ON edu_subjects FOR INSERT
       TO authenticated
       WITH CHECK (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));
     ```

   - **UPDATE Policy** (for system admins only - THE CRITICAL FIX):
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "System admins can update edu_subjects"
       ON edu_subjects FOR UPDATE
       TO authenticated
       USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()))
       WITH CHECK (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));
     ```

   - **DELETE Policy** (for system admins only):
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "System admins can delete edu_subjects"
       ON edu_subjects FOR DELETE
       TO authenticated
       USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));
     ```

   - **Service Role Policy** (for Edge Functions and admin operations):
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Service role full access to edu_subjects"
       ON edu_subjects FOR ALL
       TO service_role
       USING (true)
       WITH CHECK (true);
     ```

### Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Explicit Operation Control**: Each operation (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) has its own policy
2. **Better Debugging**: If an issue occurs, it's easier to identify which specific operation is failing
3. **Proper Access Separation**: Read access is granted to all authenticated users, while write access is restricted to system admins
4. **Clearer Security Model**: The security rules are more transparent and easier to audit

## Verification

After applying the migration, the following policies are now active on `edu_subjects`:

| Policy Name | Operation | USING Clause | WITH CHECK Clause |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Authenticated users can view edu_subjects | SELECT | true | N/A |
| System admins can insert edu_subjects | INSERT | N/A | is_admin_user(auth.uid()) |
| System admins can update edu_subjects | UPDATE | is_admin_user(auth.uid()) | is_admin_user(auth.uid()) |
| System admins can delete edu_subjects | DELETE | is_admin_user(auth.uid()) | N/A |
| Service role full access to edu_subjects | ALL | true | true |

## What System Admins Can Now Do

✅ Create new subjects with logos
✅ Update existing subjects including the `logo_url` field
✅ Delete subjects
✅ View all subjects

## Security Considerations

- The `is_admin_user()` helper function uses `SECURITY DEFINER` to bypass RLS when checking the `admin_users` table
- This prevents circular RLS dependency issues
- Only users with records in the `admin_users` table can perform write operations
- All authenticated users can view subjects (read-only access)
- Storage policies allow authenticated users to upload logos to the `subject-logos` bucket
- Public read access is enabled on the storage bucket for displaying logos

## Testing Recommendations

1. **As a System Admin:**
   - Create a new subject with a logo
   - Edit an existing subject and update its logo
   - Delete a subject with a logo

2. **As a Non-Admin User:**
   - Verify you can view subjects
   - Verify you cannot create, update, or delete subjects

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Upload logos of different formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG)
   - Test file size limit (max 2MB)
   - Remove a logo from a subject
   - Update a subject with an existing logo to a new logo
