# Tenants Management Data Fetching Error - Root Cause Analysis & Fix

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive root cause analysis and resolution for the persistent data fetching errors affecting the **Schools** and **Branches** tabs in the Tenants Management module.

## Problem Statement

Users experienced consistent failures when attempting to access data in:
- Schools Tab: "Failed to fetch schools" error
- Branches Tab: "Failed to fetch branches" error

The Companies tab functioned correctly, indicating the issue was specific to schools and branches data access.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Supabase Auth Credentials Not Included in Requests

**Root Cause:** The Supabase client was configured with `credentials: 'same-origin'` in the fetch configuration, which prevented authentication cookies and headers from being properly included in API requests.

**Impact:** When the frontend made requests to Supabase, the `auth.uid()` function in Row Level Security (RLS) policies returned `NULL` because the authentication token wasn't passed, causing all policy checks to fail.

### Contributing Factors

1. **RLS Policy Configuration**
   - Schools and branches tables have RLS enabled with policies that check `is_admin_user(auth.uid())`
   - Without proper auth credentials, `auth.uid()` returns NULL
   - Policies correctly deny access when user authentication cannot be verified

2. **Dual Authentication System**
   - The application uses both custom local authentication AND Supabase Auth
   - During login, users authenticate with Supabase Auth (`supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`)
   - The session must be maintained across all Supabase requests

3. **WebContainer Environment Considerations**
   - Running in a WebContainer/StackBlitz environment
   - Cross-origin requests require explicit credential inclusion
   - The 'same-origin' policy doesn't work for Supabase's remote database

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Fixed Supabase Client Credentials Configuration ✅

**File:** `/src/lib/supabase.ts`

**Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
credentials: 'same-origin',

// AFTER (correct)
credentials: 'include',
```

**Rationale:** The 'include' setting ensures that authentication cookies and headers are sent with every request, even for cross-origin requests to Supabase.

### 2. Enhanced Error Logging and Diagnostics ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/system-admin/tenants/tabs/SchoolsTab.tsx`
- `/src/app/system-admin/tenants/tabs/BranchesTab.tsx`

**Improvements:**
- Added comprehensive console logging to track query execution
- Log authentication session status before queries
- Test `is_admin_user()` function before data fetching
- Capture and display detailed error information (message, code, details, hint)
- Provide user-friendly error messages based on error codes

**Example Logging Output:**
```
=== BRANCHES QUERY DEBUG START ===
Auth session exists: true
Auth user ID: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
Is admin user: true
Executing branches query...
✅ Branches query successful. Count: 15
=== BRANCHES QUERY DEBUG END ===
```

### 3. Created RLS Diagnostic Component ✅

**New File:** `/src/components/shared/RLSDiagnostic.tsx`

**Features:**
- Real-time testing of authentication status
- Verification of `admin_users` table access
- Testing of `is_admin_user()` function
- Direct testing of schools and branches table access
- Detailed error reporting with expandable JSON details
- Visual status indicators (success/error/pending)

**Access:** Click "Show Diagnostics" button on the Tenants Management page

### 4. Enhanced Tenants Page ✅

**File:** `/src/app/system-admin/tenants/page.tsx`

**Improvements:**
- Added "Show/Hide Diagnostics" toggle button
- Integrated RLS Diagnostic component
- Allows administrators to quickly diagnose authentication and permission issues

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Navigate to Tenants Management → Schools tab
   - Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console
   - Look for "=== SCHOOLS QUERY DEBUG START ===" logs
   - Verify "Auth session exists: true"
   - Verify "Is admin user: true"
   - Verify "✅ Schools query successful"

2. **Run Diagnostics Tool**
   - Navigate to System Admin → Tenants Management
   - Click "Show Diagnostics" button
   - Click "Run Diagnostics"
   - All 5 tests should show green checkmarks:
     - ✅ Supabase Auth Session
     - ✅ admin_users Table Access
     - ✅ is_admin_user() Function
     - ✅ schools Table Access
     - ✅ branches Table Access

3. **Verify Data Display**
   - Schools tab should display school records
   - Branches tab should display branch records
   - No "Failed to fetch" error messages

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via `/app/signin`
2. `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` creates Supabase Auth session
3. Session token stored in cookies/localStorage
4. All subsequent Supabase requests include auth token (with `credentials: 'include'`)
5. RLS policies evaluate `auth.uid()` successfully
6. `is_admin_user()` function checks if user exists in `admin_users` table
7. Data access granted based on policy evaluation

### RLS Policy Structure

**Schools Table Policies:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "System admins can view all schools"
  ON schools FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));
```

**Branches Table Policies:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "System admins can view all branches"
  ON branches FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin_user(auth.uid()));
```

**Helper Function:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_admin_user(user_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM admin_users
    WHERE id = user_id
  );
END;
$$;
```

The `SECURITY DEFINER` attribute allows the function to bypass RLS when checking the `admin_users` table, preventing circular dependencies.

## Error Code Reference

Common error codes and their meanings:

| Code | Meaning | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| PGRST301 | RLS policy violation | Check if user is authenticated and has required permissions |
| 42501 | Permission denied | User doesn't have access rights to the table |
| PGRST116 | No rows returned | Not an error - query was successful but returned no data |

## Preventive Measures

1. **Always use `credentials: 'include'` for Supabase clients** in environments where the database is hosted remotely
2. **Implement comprehensive error logging** in all data fetching hooks to quickly diagnose issues
3. **Use diagnostic tools** to verify authentication and RLS policies after making changes
4. **Test authentication flow** after any changes to the Supabase client configuration
5. **Monitor browser console** for authentication-related errors during development

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep `credentials: 'include'` in the Supabase client configuration

- Monitor the browser console for authentication errors during testing
- Ensure all users authenticate via Supabase Auth before accessing protected data

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Run the RLS Diagnostic tool and capture the results
2. Check browser console for detailed error messages
3. Verify the user exists in the `admin_users` table
4. Ensure the user's email is confirmed in Supabase Auth
5. Check that RLS is enabled on schools and branches tables
6. Verify that the `is_admin_user()` function exists and has SECURITY DEFINER
