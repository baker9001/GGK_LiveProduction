## 📊 What Gets Created

### Per School Configuration

- **4 Teachers** with:
  - Realistic names and contact info
  - Random specializations (Mathematics, Physics, Biology, etc.)
  - Varied qualifications and experience
  - School and branch assignments
  - Unique teacher codes

- **40 Students** (8 per grade across 5 grades) with:
  - Realistic names and contact info
  - Grade level and section assignments
  - Parent/guardian information
  - Emergency contact details
  - Unique student codes and enrollment numbers

### Standard Test Password

All test accounts use: **`TestPass123!`**

---

## 🔧 Key Features

### ✅ Production-Ready Flow

- Uses `userCreationService.createUserWithInvitation()`
- Integrates with Edge Functions (`create-teacher-student-user`)
- Respects all RLS policies and access control rules
- Creates proper auth.users and entity table entries

### ✅ Realistic Data

- Random but realistic names
- Proper email format: `firstname.lastname.role@testschool.edu`
- Phone numbers in format: `XXX-XXX-XXXX`
- Valid dates and codes
- Varied specializations and qualifications

### ✅ Comprehensive Metadata

All test accounts include:
- `test_account: true` flag for easy identification
- `created_via: 'seed_script'` for tracking
- Timestamp of creation
- All required profile information

### ✅ Safety Features

- Handles duplicate emails gracefully
- Validates database structure before seeding
- Creates default grade levels if needed
- Provides detailed error messages
- Respects rate limiting with delays

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Database Prerequisites

✅ At least one active company
✅ At least one active school with branches
✅ Supabase environment variables configured

### Optional

- Edge Function deployed (script has fallback)
- Grade levels configured (script creates defaults)

---

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

### 1. Feature Testing

Test license assignment, grade management, class sections, etc. with realistic data.

```bash
npm run seed-test-users
```

### 2. Access Control Testing

Verify scope-based permissions work correctly across different user types.

### 3. UI Development

Populate UI with realistic data for development and screenshots.

### 4. Training & Demos

Create demo accounts for training sessions or product demonstrations.

---

## 🔐 Security & Cleanup

### Test Account Identification

All accounts are marked with:
```json
{
  "test_account": true,
  "created_via": "seed_script"
}
```

### Cleanup Test Data

Remove all test accounts:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE raw_user_meta_data->>'test_account' = 'true';
```

**⚠️ Warning:** This permanently deletes all test data and cascades to related tables.

## 🎨 Customization

### Adjust Number of Users

Edit `scripts/seedTestUsers.ts` around line 394:

```typescript
// Configuration
const TEACHERS_PER_SCHOOL = 4;   // Change this
const STUDENTS_PER_GRADE = 8;    // Change this
```

### Change Test Password

Edit `scripts/seedTestUsers.ts` around line 33:

```typescript
const TEST_PASSWORD = 'YourCustomPassword123!';
```

### Modify Specializations

Edit the `TEACHER_SPECIALIZATIONS` array in `seedTestUsers.ts`:

```typescript
const TEACHER_SPECIALIZATIONS = [
  ['Mathematics', 'Statistics'],
  ['Your', 'Custom', 'Subjects'],
  // Add more...
];
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No active schools found"

**Solution:** Create at least one active school with branches:

```sql
-- Example
INSERT INTO schools (name, code, company_id, status)
VALUES ('Test School', 'TST', '[company-id]', 'active');

INSERT INTO branches (name, code, school_id, status)
VALUES ('Main Branch', 'MAIN', '[school-id]', 'active');
```

### "Email already exists"

**Normal behavior:** The script skips existing emails on subsequent runs.

### "Failed to create user"

**Possible causes:**
1. Edge Function not deployed
2. Missing Supabase configuration
3. Database connection issue

**Check:**
- Supabase Edge Function logs
- Environment variables in `.env`
- Database RLS policies
