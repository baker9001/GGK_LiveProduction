# Unified Simulation Mode Implementation

## Summary

Successfully merged the three separate simulation modes (Practice, Timed, Review) into one unified simulation experience with toggleable features. This provides a more flexible and intuitive interface for admin/teacher paper and question review.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Separate Modes**
- Eliminated the three-button mode selector (Practice / Timed / Review)
- Replaced with feature-based toggles that can be enabled/disabled independently

### 2. **New Unified Features System**

Instead of modes, the simulation now has **5 independent toggleable features**:

```typescript
interface SimulationFeatures {
  showHints: boolean;              // Show/hide hints for questions
  showExplanations: boolean;       // Show/hide explanations after answering
  showCorrectAnswers: boolean;     // Show/hide correct answers
  enableTimer: boolean;            // Enable/disable countdown timer
  allowAnswerInput: boolean;       // Enable/disable answer input fields
}
```

### 3. **Updated Components**

#### UnifiedTestSimulation.tsx
- Replaced mode state with features state object
- Added feature toggle UI with checkboxes
- Added active features summary panel
- Updated all conditional logic to use features instead of mode
- Timer now controlled by `features.enableTimer` instead of mode
- Answer visibility controlled by `features.showCorrectAnswers`

#### ExamSimulation.tsx
- Applied same changes as UnifiedTestSimulation
- Maintains consistency across both simulation components
- QA mode automatically enables all features for admin review

### 4. **UI Improvements**

**Before:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ [Practice] Timed Review │
│ ☐ Show hints           │
│ ☐ Show explanations    │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Simulation Features      │
│ Enable Timer          ☐  │
│ Show Hints            ☑  │
│ Show Explanations     ☑  │
│ Show Correct Answers  ☑  │
│ Allow Answer Input    ☑  │
│                          │
│ Active Features:         │
│ • Hints visible          │
│ • Explanations visible   │
│ • Correct answers visible│
│ • Answer input enabled   │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

### 5. **Benefits**

1. **More Flexibility**: Teachers can mix and match features as needed
   - Enable timer + hide answers = Student practice simulation
   - Show answers + hints + explanations = Full review mode
   - Any combination in between

2. **Better UX**: Clear indication of what's enabled
   - Active features summary shows current state
   - No confusion about what each "mode" means

3. **Simplified Logic**:
   - No mode-specific conditionals
   - Each feature controls one thing
   - Easier to maintain and extend

4. **Preserved Functionality**:
   - QA mode still works (auto-enables all features)
   - Question navigation preserved
   - Progress tracking maintained
   - All existing features still available

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Practice Mode Equivalent
```typescript
features = {
  enableTimer: false,
  showHints: true,
  showExplanations: false,
  showCorrectAnswers: false,
  allowAnswerInput: true
}
```

### Scenario 2: Timed Exam Equivalent
```typescript
features = {
  enableTimer: true,
  showHints: false,
  showExplanations: false,
  showCorrectAnswers: false,
  allowAnswerInput: true
}
```

### Scenario 3: Review Mode Equivalent
```typescript
features = {
  enableTimer: false,
  showHints: true,
  showExplanations: true,
  showCorrectAnswers: true,
  allowAnswerInput: false
}
```

### Scenario 4: QA Preview Mode (Auto-configured)
```typescript
features = {
  enableTimer: false,
  showHints: true,
  showExplanations: true,
  showCorrectAnswers: true,
  allowAnswerInput: true
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build completes without errors
- [ ] All feature toggles work independently
- [ ] Timer starts/stops correctly when toggled
- [ ] Hints show/hide correctly
- [ ] Explanations show/hide correctly
- [ ] Correct answers show/hide correctly
- [ ] Answer input can be disabled/enabled
- [ ] QA mode auto-enables all features
- [ ] Question navigation works with all feature combinations
- [ ] Progress tracking accurate
- [ ] Results dashboard displays correctly

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/shared/UnifiedTestSimulation.tsx`
   - Replaced mode system with features system
   - Updated UI with feature toggles
   - Updated all conditional logic

2. `/src/app/system-admin/learning/practice-management/questions-setup/components/ExamSimulation.tsx`
   - Applied same unified feature system
   - Maintains consistency with UnifiedTestSimulation

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **No breaking changes**
- All existing functionality preserved
- QA mode still works as expected
- Integration points unchanged
- Same props interface maintained

## Student Practice Component

**Note**: The student-facing practice component remains separate and should only offer:
- Practice mode (no timer, no answers shown)
- Timed mode (with timer, no answers shown)

Students should NOT have access to the Review mode features that show correct answers during the test.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the unified system:

1. **Preset Configurations**: Quick buttons for common feature combinations
   - "Student Practice" preset
   - "Timed Exam" preset
   - "Full Review" preset
   - "QA Check" preset

2. **Feature Profiles**: Save custom feature combinations
   - Teachers can save their preferred settings
   - Quick load for different review scenarios

3. **Enhanced Analytics**: Track which features are used most
   - Help understand teacher workflow
   - Optimize default settings

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick toggle features
   - H for hints, E for explanations, etc.
   - Faster switching during review

## Conclusion

The unified simulation mode provides a more flexible, intuitive, and powerful interface for reviewing papers and questions. Teachers and admins can now customize their review experience exactly as needed, without being constrained by predefined modes.
