# URGENT: Login Issue FIXED - Test Immediately

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Error Fixed:** "Failed to retrieve user information. Please try again."

---

## What Was Wrong

The RLS policy on the users table was blocking login queries because:
- Policy checked: `auth.uid() = id` (ID column)
- Login query: `WHERE email = 'user@example.com'` (EMAIL column)
- **Mismatch → RLS blocked → Login failed**

## What Was Fixed

Added new RLS policy:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own record by email"
  ON users FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (email = auth.email());
```

Now users can query by BOTH ID and EMAIL ✅
