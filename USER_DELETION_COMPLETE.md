## üìù NOTES

**Previous User Type:** 'entity' (not a system admin)
**New User Type:** Will be 'system' (true system admin)

**Why Deleted:**
- User was incorrectly created as 'entity' type
- Need to test proper system admin creation
- Testing new invitation_status tracking
- Verifying getUserType function fix

**Key Difference:**
- Old: getUserTypes() returned array, used first element
- New: getUserType() returns single string directly
- Old: user_type might have been incorrect
- New: user_type will be 'system' for system admins
