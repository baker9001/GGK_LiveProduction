# White Screen Error Fix - Quick Reference

## Issue
When clicking "Preview & Test" button in the Past Papers Import Wizard, a white screen appeared instead of the test simulation.

## Error Message
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')
at DynamicAnswerField.tsx:1360
```

## Root Cause
The new QA preview mode attempted to find the correct MCQ option by checking:
```typescript
const correctOption = question.options?.find(opt =>
  opt.is_correct || ans.answer.includes(opt.label)
);
```

However, `opt.label` could be `undefined`, causing the `.includes()` method to throw an error.

## Solution
Added proper null/undefined checks before calling `.includes()`:

```typescript
const correctOption = question.options?.find(opt =>
  opt.is_correct || (opt.label && ans.answer && ans.answer.includes(opt.label))
);
```

## File Changed
- **Location:** `src/components/shared/DynamicAnswerField.tsx`
- **Line:** 1360
- **Change:** Added `opt.label &&` and `ans.answer &&` checks

## Testing
✅ Build successful (19.85s)
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Component renders without crashing

## Prevention
This fix demonstrates the importance of:
1. Always checking for undefined/null before calling string methods
2. Using optional chaining (`?.`) for nested object access
3. Defensive programming when dealing with optional data
4. Testing with incomplete or missing data scenarios
