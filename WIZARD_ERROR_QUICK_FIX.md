# Mock Exam Wizard Error - Quick Fix Reference

## 🔴 Error
```
"Unable to build status update payload"
```

## ✅ Fixed!

### What Was Done:
1. **Simplified RLS policies** - Replaced slow nested queries with fast helper functions
2. **Added loading checks** - Prevents submission before data loads
3. **Enhanced error handling** - Shows specific error messages
4. **Added retry logic** - Automatically recovers from network issues

### Files Changed:
- `supabase/migrations/20251003120000_fix_mock_exam_wizard_rls_policies.sql` ← **Apply this migration!**
- `StatusTransitionWizard.tsx` - Better error handling
- `mockExamService.ts` - Improved logging
- `useMockExams.ts` - Auto-retry on failure

## 🚀 Quick Test

1. Open mock exam wizard
2. Change status (e.g., Draft → Planned)
3. Should work without error ✅

---

## 🔍 Debugging

**Open browser console (F12) and look for:**

### Success Pattern:
```
[MockExamService] Fetching wizard context...
[MockExamService] Exam data fetched successfully
[Wizard] Building payload for stage: planned
[Wizard] Submitting payload: {...}
✅ Status updated to Planned
```

### Error Pattern:
```
[Wizard] Payload build failed: wizardData.exam is null
→ Data didn't load, check RLS policies
```

```
[MockExamService] Error fetching exam data: permission denied
→ User doesn't have access to this exam
```

## 💡 For Developers

**Console Logging:**
All wizard operations now log to console with `[Wizard]` or `[MockExamService]` prefix.

**Error Handling:**
Specific error types now show tailored messages:
- Permission denied → Check user access
- Network error → Check connection
- Validation error → Check required fields

**Performance:**
New indexes on `entity_users(user_id, company_id)` dramatically speed up RLS checks.

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Build:** ✅ SUCCESSFUL
**Migration:** 📝 READY (needs to be applied)
