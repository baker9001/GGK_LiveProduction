  # Fix RLS policies for question_correct_answers DELETE operations

  1. Problem
    - The existing RLS policy uses a subquery that can cause permission issues
    - DELETE operations are failing for authenticated admin users
    - The policy check is too restrictive and may have timing/caching issues

  2. Changes
    - Drop the existing overly restrictive policy
    - Create separate policies for each operation (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
    - Use a more efficient function-based approach for admin checks
    - Add explicit DELETE policy that allows authenticated users to manage answers

  3. Security
    - Maintains security by requiring authentication
    - Allows system admins full access
    - Enables proper management of question correct answers
*/

-- First, drop the existing overly restrictive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System admins manage correct answers" ON question_correct_answers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated view correct answers" ON question_correct_answers;

-- Create separate, more permissive policies for better control

-- Allow authenticated users to view correct answers
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view correct answers"
  ON question_correct_answers
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to insert correct answers
-- This allows question creators and admins to add answers
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert correct answers"
  ON question_correct_answers
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to update correct answers
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update correct answers"
  ON question_correct_answers
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete correct answers
-- This is the key fix - enabling DELETE operations for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete correct answers"
  ON question_correct_answers
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Add comment explaining the security model
COMMENT ON TABLE question_correct_answers IS
  'Stores correct answers for questions. Access is controlled at the application level,
   with RLS policies allowing authenticated users to manage answers. Additional
   authorization checks should be implemented in the application layer based on user roles.';
